## [2.6.0] 2019-01-31

This is a special release for meeting the deadline of debian buster freeze (debian 10).

### Added
- New acquisition and synchronization concepts (SEP18, #773):
  - Preparation of measurement group for a group of acquisitions is mandatory
    (`Prepare` Tango command and `prepare` core method; `NbStarts` Tango
    attribute and `nb_starts` core attribute; `count`, `count_raw` and
    `count_continuous` methods in Taurus extension)
  - Preparation of timerable controllers is optional (`PrepareOne` method)

    `Start` in `AcqSynchType` enumeration (the second one is available in
    the `expconf` as synchronization option)

  - `PoolAcquisitionSoftwareStart` acquisition action
  - `SoftwareStart` and `HardwareStart` synchronization in
    `DummyCounterTimerController`
- Support to Qt5 for Sardana-Taurus widgets and Sardana-Taurus extensions (#1006,
  #1009)
- Possibility to define macros with optional parameters. These must be the last
  ones in the definition (#285, #876, #943, #941, #955)
- Possibility to pass values of repeat parameters with just one member without
  the need to encapsulate them in square brackets (spock syntax) or list
  (macro API) (#781, #983)

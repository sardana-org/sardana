## [Unreleased]

### Added
- addctrlib, relctrllib, relctrlcls macros usefull when developing
  controller classes (#541)
- Timeout/watchdog in continuous scans - especially usefull when
  triggers may be missed e.g. not precise positioning (#136, #601)
- Reintroduce intermediate events for counter/timer channels while
  software acquisition is in progress (#625)
- TaurusCounterTimerController - that can connect to different data
  sources e.g. EPICS by using Taurus schemes (#628)

  with udefmeas and udefctrl macros respectivelly (#361, #547)
- Improve exception hangling in ascanct & co. (#600)
- Allow to hide Taurus 4 related deprecation warnings
  (`TAURUS_MAX_DEPRECATION_COUNTS` sardana custom setting) (#550)
- Optional data extrapolation for the very first records in ascanct & co.
  (`ApplyExtrapolation` environment variable) (#588)
- Inform about an error when reading the sofware synchronized channel so
  the record can be completed - value for the given trigger will not
  arrive anymore (#581, #582)
- `--file` option to sequencer - it allows to load a sequence file
  directly on the application startup moment (#283, #551)
- Report error line number when loading a sequence from a txt file
  fails (#114, #552)
- Present available pools at the macroserver creation moment in the
  alphabetical order (#585, #586)
- Present available doors at the spock profile creation moment in the
  alphabetical order (#221, #558)
- Some backwards compatibility for element names in PQDN - recently
  Taurus started using only FQDN (#625, #627)
- Improve DumbRecorder (example of a custom file recorder) to write to
  a file.
- Data in scan Records can now be accessed via dict-like syntax (#644)
- Example of a macro that uses other macros as hooks #649

### Fixed
- Spock waits until macro stopping is finished after Ctrl+C (#34. #596)
- Acquisition start sequence which in case of starting disabled channels
  could unintentionally change the measurement group's configuration (#607,
  #615)
- Selection of the master timer/monitor for each of the acquisition
  sub-actions (hardware and software) (#614)
- Avoid "already involved in motion" errors due to wrong handling of
  operation context and Tango state machine (#639)
- Make the information about the element's instrument fully dynamic and
  remove it from the serialized information (#122, #619)
- uct macro (#319, #627)
- Allow to stop macro when it was previously paused (#348, #548)
- Bug in theoretical motor position in ascanct & co. (#591)
- Counter/timer TaurusValue widget when used with Taurus 4 - correctly show
  the element's name (#617)
- `relmaclib` reports the error message in case the macro has parameters
  definition is incorrect (#377, #642)
- Icons in macroexecution widgets when used with Taurus 4 (#578)
- Spurious errors when reading RecordData attribute, normally triggered
  on event subscription e.g. macrogui (#447, #598)
- Possible too early acquisition triggering by trigger/gate due to the
  wrong order ot starting trigger/gate and software synchronizer in the
  synchronization action (#597)
- Validation of motor positions agains their limits in ascanct & co. (#595)
- Generation of theoretical timestamps in ascanct & co. (#602)
- Maintain macrobutton's text when MacroServer is shut down (#293, #559)
- Number of repetitions (always pass 1) passed to experimental channel
  controllers in case software synchronization is in use (#594)
- `Hookable.hooks` proprty setting - now it cleans the previous
  configuration (#655)
- Make PoolUtil thread-safe (#662, #655)
- Dummy counter/timer now returns partial value when its acquisition was
  aborted (#626)
- Workaround for #427: make default values for repeat parameters of `wa`,
  `pwa` and all list macros fully functional - also support execution with
  `Macro.execMacro` (#654)

### Changed
- Internally use URI (FQDN) references to be fully compatible with Taurus4
- Rename edctrl to edctrlcls macro (#541)
- The way how the master timer/monitor for the acquisition actions is selected.
  Previously the first one for the given synchronization was used, now it is
  taken into account if it is enabled or disabled (next ones may be used then).
  (#647, #648)
- Macrobutton's text to from "<macro_name>" to "Run/Abort <macro_name>"
  (#322, #554, #658)

### Removed
- `ElementList` attribute from the Door Tango device - `Element` attribute is
  available on the MacroServer device (#556, #557, #653)

### Changed
- `ascanct` & co. macro parameters to more resemble parameters of step scans
  (SEP6)
- `trigger_type` was renamed to `synchronization` in Measurement Group
  configuration and as the experimental channel controller parameter (SEP6)
- make the new NXscanH5_FileRecorder the default one for .h5 files (#460) 
- A part of the 0D's core API was changed in order to be more consistent with
  the new concept of value buffer (#469):
  - `BaseAccumulation.append_value` -> `BaseAccumulation.append`
  - `Value.get_value_buffer` -> `Value.get_accumulation_buffer`
  - `Value.append_value` -> `Value.append_buffer`

  acquiring with the count updates - temporarily removed (SEP6)
- units level from the Measurement Group configuration (#218)

### Fixed

  #505. #510)

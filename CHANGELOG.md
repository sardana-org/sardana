## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New recorder for NXscan that does not use the nxs module (NAPI) but h5py
  instead (#460)
- New spock syntax based on the square brackets to use repeat parameters
  without limitations (#405)
- Possibility to duplicate repeats of the repeat parameters in macroexecutor
  and sequencer (#426)
- Tooltip with parameters description in the macro execution widgets:
  MacroExecutor and Sequencer (#302)
- Generic main to the macrobutton widget that allows to execute "any" macro
- TriggerGate element and its controller to plug in hardware with
  the synchronization capabilities (SEP6)
- software synchronizer that emulate hardware TriggerGate elements (SEP6)
- possibility to execute multiple, synchronized by hardware or software, 
  in time or position domain (also non equidistant) acquisitions with the
  Measurement Group (SEP6)
- CTExpChannel may report acquired and indexed values in chunks in
  continuous acquisition (SEP6)
- 0DExpChannel may report acquired and indexed values in chunks in
  continuous acquisition (#469)
- PseudoCounter may return calculated (from the buffered physical
  channels values) and indexed values in chunks in continuous acquisition
  (#469) 
- `timescan` macro to run equidistant time scans and `TScan` class to
  develop custom time scans (#104, #485)
- `synchronizer` parameter to the Measurement Group configuration (SEP6)
- `latency_time` parameter to the experimental channel controllers (SEP6)
- `ApplyInterpolation` environment variable, applicable to `ascanct` & co.
  (SEP6)
- "How to write a counter/timer controller" documentation (SEP6)
- "How to write a trigger/gate controller" documentation (SEP6)
- Flake8 check-on-push for CI (#451)
- Possibility to specify the IORegister value attribute data type between
  `int`, `float` or `bool` even in the same controller (#459, #458)

### Changed
- make the new NXscanH5_FileRecorder the default one for .h5 files (#460) 
- `ascanct` & co. macro parameters to more resemble parameters of step scans
  (SEP6)
- `trigger_type` was renamed to `synchronization` in Measurement Group
  configuration and as the experimental channel controller parameter (SEP6)
- Applied AutoPEP8 to whole project (#446)
- A part of the 0D's core API was changed in order to be more consistent with
  the new concept of value buffer (#469):
  - `BaseAccumulation.append_value` -> `BaseAccumulation.append`
  - `Value.get_value_buffer` -> `Value.get_accumulation_buffer`
  - `Value.append_value` -> `Value.append_buffer`
  - `PoolZeoDExpChannel.get_value_buffer` -> `PoolZeoDExpChannel.get_accumulation_buffer`
  - `PoolZeoDExpChannel.value_buffer` -> `PoolZeoDExpChannel.accumulation_buffer`
- `nr_of_points` attribute of `aNscan` calss was renamed to `nr_points`
- IORegister value attribute default data type from `int` to `float` and as a
  consequence its Tango attribute data type from `DevLong` to `DevDouble` and
  the `write_ioreg` and `read_ioreg` macro parameter and result type respectively
  (#459, #458)
- Use of ordereddict module. Now it is used from the standard library (Python >= 2.7)
  instead of `taurus.external`. For Python 2.6 users this means a new dependency
  `ordereddict` from PyPI (#482)

### Deprecated
- `LoadOne` API had changed - `repetitions` was added as a mandatory argument
  and the old API is deprecated (SEP6)
- OD's `ValueBuffer` Tango attribute is deprecated in favor of the
  `AccumulationBuffer` attribute (#469)

### Removed
- units level from the Measurement Group configuration (#218)
- intermediate events being emitted by the CTExpChannel Value attribute while
  acquiring with the count updates (SEP6)

### Fixed
- Macro execution widgets connecting to the MacroServer in a Tango database
  different than the default one e.g. using `--tango-host` option
- macrobutton widget working with the string parameters containing white spaces
  (#423)

	Abstract:
	Nowadays, access to the environment variables of the MacroServer is not 
	user friendly. MacroServer exposes its environment as an event driven 
	attribute called Environment, with a pickled dictionary as its value. 
	We propose a taurus scheme, msenv, responsible for translating each 
	variable of the enviroment to a taurus attribute.

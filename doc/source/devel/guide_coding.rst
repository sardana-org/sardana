How to contribute to Sardana
----------------------------

Sardana development is managed with the `Sardana github project
<https://github.com/sardana-org/sardana>`_. 

Apart from directly contributing code, you can contribute to Sardana in many
ways, such as reporting bugs or proposing new features. In all cases you will
probably need a github account and you are strongly encouraged to subscribe to the
`sardana-devel and sardana-users mailing lists <https://sourceforge.net/p/sardana/mailman/>`_.

We also invite you to join the regular project `follow-up meetings <https://github.com/sardana-org/sardana-followup>`_. These are announced on the previously mentioned mailing list.

Detailed instructions on how to contribute to code or documentation can be found in
`CONTRIBUTING.md <https://github.com/sardana-org/sardana/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

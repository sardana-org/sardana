Introduction
============

This paper describes what could be the implementation of the Sardana
device pool. This work is based on Jorg's paper called "Reordered
SPEC_". It is **not at all** a final version of this device pool. It is rather
a first approach to define this pool more precisely and to help defining its
features and the way it could be implemented. 


Overall pool design
===================

The pool could be seen as a kind of intelligent Tango_ device container
to control the experiment hardware. In a first approach, it requires
that the hardware to be controlled is connected to the control
computer or to external crate(s) connected to the control computer
using bus coupler. It has two basic features which are: 

1. Hardware access using dynamically created/deleted Tango_ devices
   according to the experiment needs

2. Management of some very common and well defined action regularly done
   on a beam line (scanning, motor position archiving....)

To achieve these two goals and to provide the user with a way to
control its behavior, it is implemented as a Tango_ class with commands
and attributes like any other Tango_ class. 


Hardware access
---------------


Core hardware access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most of the times, it is possible to define a list of very common
devices found in most of the experiments, a list of communication link
used between the experiment hardware and the control computer(s) and
some of the most commonly used protocol used on these communication
links. Devices commonly used to drive an experiment are: 

- Motor

- Group of motor

- Pseudo motor

- Counter/Timer

- Multi Channel Analyzer

- CCD cameras

- And some other that I don't know

Communication link used to drive experiment devices are: 

- Serial line

- GPIB

- Socket

- And some other that I don't know (USB????)

Protocol used on the communication links are: 

- Modbus

- Ans some other that I don't know

Each of the controlled hardware (one motor, one pseudo-motor, one
serial line device,...) will be driven by independent Tango_ classes.
The pool device server will embed all these Tango_ classes together
(statically linked). The pool Tango_ device is the "container
interface" and allows the user to create/delete classical Tango_
devices which are instances of these embedded classes. This is
summarized in the following drawing.

.. image:: /_static/hard.png

Therefore, the three main actions to control a new equipment using the
pool will be (assuming the equipment is connected to the control
computer via a serial line): 

1. Create the serial line Tango_ device with one of the Pool device
   command assigning it a name like "MyNewEquipment".

2. Connect to this newly created Tango_ device using its assigned name

3. Send order or write/read data to/from the new equipment using for
   instance the WriteRead command of the serial line Tango_ device

When the experiment does not need this new equipment any more, the
user can delete the serial line Tango_ device with another pool device
command. Note that most of the time, creating Tango_ device means
defining some device configuration parameters (Property in Tango_
language). The Tango_ wizard will be used to retrieve which properties
have to be defined and will allow the user to set them on the fly.
This means that all the Tango_ classes embedded within the Pool must
have their wizard initialized. 


Extending pool features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

From time to time, it could be useful to extend the list of Tango_
classes known by the device pool in case a new kind of equipment (not
using the core hardware access) is added to the experiment. Starting
with Tango_ 5.5 (and the associated Pogo), each Tango_ class has a
method which allow the class to be dynamically loaded into a running
process. This feature will be used to extend the pool feature. It has
to be checked that it is possible for Tango_ Python class.

.. image:: /_static/dyn.png

To achieve this feature, the pool Tango_ device will have commands to 

- Load a Tango_ class. This command will dynamically add two other
  commands and one attribute to the pool device Tango_ interface. These
  commands and the attribute are:

    - Command: Create a device of the newly loaded class
    
    - Command: Delete a device of the newly loaded class
    
    - Attribute: Get the list of Tango_ devices instances of the newly
      created class
    
    
- Unload a Tango_ class

- Reload a Tango_ class


Global actions
--------------

The following common actions regularly done on a beam line experiment
will be done by the pool device server: 

- Evaluating user constraint(s) before moving motor(s)

- Scanning

- Saving experiment data

- Experiment management

- Archiving motor positions


Sardana core hardware access
============================


The Sardana Motor management
----------------------------


The user motor interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The motor interface is a first approach of what could be a complete
motor interface. It is statically linked with the Pool device server
and supports several attributes and commands. It is implemented in C++
and used a set of the so-called "controller" methods. The motor
interface is always the same whatever the hardware is. This is the
rule of the "controller" to access the hardware using the
communication link supported by the motor controller hardware (network
link, serial line...).

.. image:: /_static/motor.png

The controller code has a well-defined interface and can be written
using Python or C++. In both cases, it will be dynamically loaded into
the pool device server process. 


The states
""""""""""

The motor interface knows five states which are ON, MOVING, ALARM,
FAULT and UNKNOWN. A motor device is in MOVING state when it is
moving! It is in ALARM state when it has reached one of the limit
switches and is in FAULT if its controller software is not available
(impossible to load it) or if a fault is reported from the hardware
controller. The motor is in the UNKNOWN state if an exception occurs
during the communication between the pool and the hardware controller.
When the motor is in ALARM state, its status will indicate which limit
switches is active. 


The commands
""""""""""""

The motor interface supports 3 commands on top of the Tango_ classical
Init, State and Status commands. These commands are summarized in the
following table:

============  ================  ================
Command name  Input data type   Output data type  
============  ================  ================
Abort         void              void              
SetPosition   Tango::DevDouble  void              
SaveConfig    void              void              
============  ================  ================

- **Abort** : It aborts a running motion. This command does not have input or
  output argument.

- **SetPosition** : Loads a position into controller. It has one input argument which is
  the new position value (a double). It is allowed only in the ON or
  ALARM states. The unit used for the command input value is the
  physical unit: millimeters or milli-radians. It is always an absolute
  position.

- **SaveConfig** : Write some of the motor parameters in database. Today, it writes the
  motor acceleration, deceleration, base_rate and velocity into database
  as motor device properties. It is allowed only in the ON or ALARM
  states

The classical Tango_ Init command destroys the motor and re-create it. 


The attributes
""""""""""""""

The motor interface supports several attributes which are summarized
in the following table:

==============  =================  ===========  ========  =========  ==========
Name            Data type          Data format  Writable  Memorized  Ope/Expert  
==============  =================  ===========  ========  =========  ==========
Position        Tango::DevDouble   Scalar       R/W       No *       Ope         
DialPosition    Tango::DevDouble   Scalar       R         No         Exp         
Offset          Tango::DevDouble   Scalar       R/W       Yes        Exp         
Acceleration    Tango::DevDouble   Scalar       R/W       No         Exp         
Base_rate       Tango::DevDouble   Scalar       R/W       No         Exp         
Deceleration    Tango::DevDouble   Scalar       R/W       No         Exp         
Velocity        Tango::DevDouble   Scalar       R/W       No         Exp         
Limit_Switches  Tango::DevBoolean  Spectrum     R         No         Exp         
SimulationMode  Tango::DevBoolean  Scalar       R         No         Exp         
Step_per_unit   Tango::DevDouble   Scalar       R/W       Yes        Exp         
Backlash        Tango::DevLong     Scalar       R/W       Yes        Exp         
==============  =================  ===========  ========  =========  ==========

- **Position** : This is read-write scalar double attribute. With the classical Tango
  min and max_value attribute properties, it is easy to define
  authorized limit for this attribute. See the definition of the
  DialPosition and Offset attributes to get a precise definition of the
  meaning of this attribute. It is not allowed to read or write this
  attribute when the motor is in FAULT or UNKNOWN state. It is also not
  possible to write this attribute when the motor is already MOVING. **The unit used for this attribute is the physical unit: millimeters or
  milli-radian. It is always an** **absolute** **position.** The value of this attribute is memorized in the Tango_ database but not
  by the default Tango_ system memorization. See chapter
  XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Archiving-motor-position}:
  for details about motor position archiving.

- **DialPosition** : This attribute is the motor dial position. The following formula
  links together the Position, DialPosition, Sign and Offset attributes: ::
  
    Position = Sign * DialPosition + Offset
  
  This allows to have the motor position centered around any position
  defined by the Offset attribute (classically the X ray beam position).
  It is a read only attribute. To set the motor position, the user has
  to use the Position attribute. It is not allowed to read this
  attribute when the motor is in FAULT or UNKNOWN mode. The unit used
  for this attribute is the physical unit: millimeters or milli-radian.
  It is also always an **absolute** position.

- **Offset** : The offset to be applied in the motor position computation. By
  default set to 0. It is a memorized attribute. It is not allowed to
  read or write this attribute when the motor is in FAULT, MOVING or
  UNKNOWN mode.

- **Acceleration** : This is an expert read-write scalar double attribute. This parameter
  value is written in database when the SaveConfig command is executed.
  It is not allowed to read or write this attribute when the motor is in
  FAULT or UNKNOWN state.

- **Deceleration** : This is an expert read-write scalar double attribute. This parameter
  value is written in database when the SaveConfig command is executed.
  It is not allowed to read or write this attribute when the motor is in
  FAULT or UNKNOWN state.

- **Base_rate** : This is an expert read-write scalar double attribute. This parameter
  value is written in database when the SaveConfig command is executed.
  It is not allowed to read or write this attribute when the motor is in
  FAULT or UNKNOWN state.

- **Velocity** : This is an expert read-write scalar double attribute. This parameter
  value is written in database when the SaveConfig command is executed.
  It is not allowed to read or write this attribute when the motor is in
  FAULT or UNKNOWN state.

- **Limit_Switches** : Three limit switches are managed by this attribute. Each of the
  switch are represented by a boolean value: False means inactive while
  True means active. It is a read only attribute. It is not possible to
  read this attribute when the motor is in UNKNOWN mode. It is a
  spectrum attribute with 3 values which are:

    - Data[0] : The Home switch value
    
    - Data[1] : The Upper switch value
    
    - Data[2] : The Lower switch value
    
    
- **SimulationMode** : This is a read only scalar boolean attribute. When set, all motion
  requests are not forwarded to the software controller and then to the
  hardware. When set, the motor position is simulated and is immediately
  set to the value written by the user. To set this attribute, the user
  has to used the pool device Tango_ interface. The value of the
  position, acceleration, deceleration, base_rate, velocity and offset
  attributes are memorized at the moment this attribute is set. When
  this mode is turned off, if the value of any of the previously
  memorized attributes has changed, it is reapplied to the memorized
  value. It is not allowed to read this attribute when the motor is in
  FAULT or UNKNOWN states.

- **Step_per_unit** : This is the number of motor step per millimeter or per degree. It is
  a memorized attribute. It is not allowed to read or write this
  attribute when the motor is in FAULT or UNKNOWN mode. It is also not
  allowed to write this attribute when the motor is MOVING. The default
  value is 1.

- **Backlash** : If this attribute is defined to something different than 0, the
  motor will always stop the motion coming from the same mechanical
  direction. This means that it could be possible to ask the motor to go
  a little bit after the desired position and then to return to the
  desired position. The attribute value is the number of steps the motor
  will pass the desired position if it arrives from the "wrong"
  direction. This is a signed value. If the sign is positive, this means
  that the authorized direction to stop the motion is the increasing
  motor position direction. If the sign is negative, this means that the
  authorized direction to stop the motion is the decreasing motor
  position direction. It is a memorized attribute. It is not allowed to
  read or write this attribute when the motor is in FAULT or UNKNOWN
  mode. It is also not allowed to write this attribute when the motor is
  MOVING. Some hardware motor controllers are able to manage this
  backlash feature. If it is not the case, the motor interface will
  implement this behavior.

All the motor devices will have the already described attributes but
some hardware motor controller supports other features which are not
covered by this list of pre-defined attributes. Using Tango_ dynamic
attribute creation, a motor device may have extra attributes used to
get/set the motor hardware controller specific features. The main
characteristics of these extra attributes are : 

- Name defined by the motor controller software (See next chapter)

- Data type is BOOLEAN, LONG, DOUBLE or STRING defined by the motor
  controller software (See next chapter)

- The data format is always Scalar

- The write type is READ or READ_WRITE defined by the motor controller
  software (See next chapter). If the write type is READ_WRITE, the
  attribute is memorized by the Tango_ layer


The motor properties
""""""""""""""""""""

Each motor device has a set of properties. Five of these properties
are automatically managed by the pool software and must not be changed
by the user. These properties are named Motor_id, _Acceleration,
_Velocity, _Base_rate and _Deceleration. The user properties are:

======================  =============
Property name           Default value  
======================  =============
Sleep_bef_last_read     0
======================  =============

This property defines the time in milli-second that the software
managing a motor movement will wait between it detects the end of the
motion and the last motor position reading. 


Getting motor state and limit switches using event
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The simplest way to know if a motor is moving is to survey its state.
If the motor is moving, its state will be MOVING. When the motion is
over, its state will be back to ON (or ALARM if a limit switch has
been reached). The pool motor interface allows client interested by
motor state or motor limit switches value to use the Tango_ event
system subscribing to motor state change event. As soon as a motor
starts a motion, its state is changed to MOVING and an event is sent.
As soon as the motion is over, the motor state is updated ans another
event is sent. In the same way, as soon as a change in the limit
switches value is detected, a change event is sent to client(s) which
have subscribed to change event on the Limit_Switches attribute. 


Reading the motor position attribute
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For each motor, the key attribute is its position. Special care has
been taken on this attribute management. When the motor is not moving,
reading the Position attribute will generate calls to the controller
and therefore hardware access. When the motor is moving, its position
is automatically read every 100 milli-seconds and stored in the Tango
polling buffer. This means that a client reading motor Position
attribute while the motor is moving will get the position from the
Tango_ polling buffer and will not generate extra controller calls. It
is also possible to get a motor position using the Tango_ event system.
When the motor is moving, an event is sent to the registered clients
when the change event criterion is true. By default, this change event
criterion is set to be a difference in position of 5. It is tunable on
a motor basis using the classical motor Position attribute abs_change
property or at the pool device basis using its DefaultMotPos_AbsChange
property. Anyway, not more than 10 events could be sent by second.
Once the motion is over, the motor position is made unavailable from
the Tango_ polling buffer and is read a last time after a tunable
waiting time (Sleep_bef_last_read property). A forced change event
with this value is sent to clients using events. 


The Motor Controller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \label{sub:The-Motor-Controller}:

Each controller code is built as a shared library or as a Python
module which is dynamically loaded by the pool device the first time
one controller using the shared library (or the module) is created.
Each controller is uniquely defined by its name following the syntax::
    
    <controller_file_name>.<controller_class_name>/<instance_name>

At controller creation time, the pool checks the controller unicity on
its control system (defined by the TANGO_HOST). It is possible to
write controller using either C++ or Python language. Even if a Tango
device server is a multi-threaded process, every access to the same
controller will be serialized by a monitor managed by the Motor
interface. This monitor is attached to the controller class and not to
the controller instance to handle cases where several instances of the
same controller class is used. For Python controller, this monitor
will also take care of taking/releasing the Python Global Interpreter
Lock (GIL) before any call to the Python controller is executed. 


The basic
"""""""""

For motor controller, a pre-defined set of methods has to be
implemented in the class implementing the controller interface. These
methods can be splitted in 6 different types which are: 

1. Methods to create/remove motor

2. Methods to move motor(s)

3. Methods to read motor(s) position

4. Methods to get motor(s) state

5. Methods to configure a motor

6. Remaining methods.

These methods, their rules and their execution sequencing is detailed
in the following sub-chapters. The motor controller software layer is
also used to inform the upper level of the features supported by the
underlying hardware. This is called the controller **features** . It is detailed in a following sub-chapter. Some controller may need
some configuration data. This will be supported using Tango
properties. This is detailed in a dedicated sub-chapter. 


Specifying the motor controller features
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A controller feature is something that motor hardware controller is
able to do or require on top of what has been qualified as the basic
rules. Even if these features are common, not all the controllers
implement them. Each of these common features are referenced by a pre-
defined string. The controller code writer defined (from a pre-defined
list) which of these features his hardware controller
implements/requires. This list (a Python list or an array of C
strings) has a well-defined name used by the upper layer software to
retrieve it. The possible strings in this list are (case independent): 

- **CanDoBacklash** : The hardware controller manages the motor backlash if the user
  defines one

- **WantRounding** : The hardware controller wants an integer number of step

- **encoder** : The hardware knows how to deal with encoder

- **home** : The hardware is able to manage home switch

- **home_acceleration** : It is possible to set the acceleration for motor homing

- **home_method** _ **xxx** : The hardware knows the home method called xxx

- **home_method_yyy** : The hardware knows the home method called yyy

The name of this list is simply: **ctrl_features** . If this list is not defined, this means that the hardware does not
support/require any of the additional features. The Tango_ motor class
will retrieve this list from the controller before the first motor
belonging to this controller is created. As an example, we suppose
that we have a pool with two classes of motor controller called Ctrl_A
and Ctrl_B. The controllers features list are (in Python) ::

    Controller A : ctrl_features = ['CanDoBacklash','encoder'] 
    ControllerB : ctrl_features = ['WantRounding','home','home_method_xxx']

All motors devices belonging to the controller A will have the Encoder
and Backlash features. For these motors, the backlash will be done by
the motor controller hardware. All the motors belonging to the
controller B will have the rounding, home and home_method features.
For these motors, the backlash will be done by the motor interface
code. 


Specifying the motor controller extra attributes
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \label{par:Specifying-the-motor}:

Some of the hardware motor controller will have features not defined
in the features list or not accessible with a pre-defined feature. To
provide an interface to these specific hardware features, the
controller code can define extra attributes. Another list called : **ctrl_extra_attributes** is used to define them. This list (Python dictionary or an array of
classical C strings) is used to define the name, data and read-write
type of the Tango_ attribute which will be created to deal with these
extra features. The attribute created for these controller extra
features are all: 

- Boolean, Long, Double or String

- Scalar

- Read or Read/Write (and memorized if Read/Write).

For Python classes (Python controller class), it is possible to define
these extra attributes informations using a Python dictionary called **ctrl_extra** _ **attributes** . The extra attribute name is the dictionary element key. The
dictionary element value is another dictionary with two members which
are the extra attribute data type and the extra attribute read/write
type. For instance, for our IcePap controller, this dictionary to
defined one extra attribute called "SuperExtra" of data type Double
which is also R/W will be::

    ctrl_extra_attributes = { "SuperExtra" : { "Type" : "DevDouble", "R/W Type", "READ_WRITE" } }

For C++ controller class, the extra attributes are defined within an
array of **Controller::ExtraAttrInfo** structures. The name of this array has to be
<Ctrl_class_name>_ctrl_extra_attributes. Each
Controller::ExtraAttrInfo structure has three elements which are all
pointers to classical C string (const char \*). These elements are:

    1. The extra attribute name
    2. The extra attribute data type
    3. The extra attribute R/W type

A NULL pointer defined the last extra attribute. The following is an
example of extra attribute definition for a controller class called
"DummyController"::

    Controller::ExtraAttrInfo DummyController_ctrl_extra_attributes[] = 
        { { "SuperExtra", "DevDouble", "Read_Write" }, NULL };
    
The string describing the extra attribute data type may have the
following value (case independent): 

- DevBoolean, DevLong, DevDouble or DevString (in Python, a preceding
  "PyTango." is allowed)

The string describing the extra attribute R/W type may have the
following value (case independent) 

- Read or Read_Write (in Python, a preceding "PyTango." is allowed)


Methods to create/remove motor from controller
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Two methods are called when creating or removing motor from a
controller. These methods are called **AddDevice** and **DeleteDevice** . The AddDevice method is called when a new motor belonging to the
controller is created within the pool. The DeleteDevice method is
called when a motor belonging to the controller is removed from the
pool. 


Methods to move motor(s)
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Four methods are used when a request to move motor(s) is executed.
These methods are called **PreStartAll** , **PreStartOne** , **StartOne** and **StartAll** .
The algorithm used to move one or several motors is the following::

    /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the motion
         - Call PreStartAll()
    /END FOR/
     
    /FOR/ Each motor(s) implied in the motion
         - ret = PreStartOne(motor to move, new position)
         - /IF/ ret is true
              - Call StartOne(motor to move, new position)
         - /END IF/
    /END FOR/
     
    /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the motion
         - Call StartAll()
    /END FOR/

The following array summarizes the rule of each of these methods:

====================  ================================  =================================  =======================================  =================================
                      PresStartAll()                    PreStartOne()                      StartOne()                               StartAll()

Typical rule          Init internal data for motion     Check if motor motion is possible  Set new motor position in internal data  Send order to physical controller  
====================  ================================  =================================  =======================================  =================================

This algorithm covers the sophisticated case where a physical
controller is able to move several motors at the same time. For some
simpler controller, it is possible to implement only the StartOne()
method. The default implementation of the three remaining methods is
defined in a way that the algorithm works even in such a case. 


Methods to read motor(s) position
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Four methods are used when a request to read motor(s) position is
received. These methods are called PreReadAll, PreReadOne, ReadAll and
ReadOne. The algorithm used to read position of one or several motors
is the following::

    /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the reading
         - Call PreReadAll()
    /END FOR/
     
    /FOR/ Each motor(s) implied in the reading
         - PreReadOne(motor to read)
    /END FOR/
     
    /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the reading
         - Call ReadAll()
    /END FOR/
     
    /FOR/ Each motor(s) implied in the reading
         - Call ReadOne(motor to read)
    /END FOR/

The following array summarizes the rule of each of these methods:

====================  ================================  ===================================  =================================  =================================================================
                      PreReadAll()                      PreReadOne()                         ReadAll()                          ReadOne()

Methods to get motor(s) state
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \label{par:Methods-to-get-state}:

Four methods are used when a request to get motor(s) state is
received. These methods are called PreStateAll, PreStateOne, StateAll
and StateOne. The algorithm used to get state of one or several motors
is the following :

         - Call PreStateAll()
    /END FOR/

Methods to configure a motor
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The rule of these methods is to 

- Get or Set motor parameter(s) with methods called GetPar() or SetPar()

- Get or Set motor extra feature(s) parameter with methods called
  GetExtraAttributePar() or SetExtraAttributePar()

The following table summarizes the usage of these methods:

=========  ==============================================================================================  ============================================================================================================  =================================================  =====================================================
           GetPar()                                                                                        SetPar()                                                                                                      GetExtraAttributePar()                             SetExtraAttributePar()

The rule of the remaining methods are to

Controller properties
"""""""""""""""""""""

XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \label{par:Controller-properties}:

Each controller may have a set of **properties** to configure itself. Properties are defined at the controller class
level but can be re-defined at the instance level. It is also possible
to define a property default value. These default values are stored
within the controller class code. If a default value is not adapted to
specific object instance, it is possible to define a new property
value which will be stored in the Tango_ database. Tango_ database
allows storing data which are not Tango_ device property. This storage
could be seen simply as a couple name/value. Naming convention for
this kind of storage could be defined as:
    
    controller_class->prop: value or 
    controller_class/instance->prop: value

The calls necessary to retrieve/insert/update these values from/to the
database already exist in the Tango_ core. The algorithm used to
retrieve a property value is the following::

    - Property value = Not defined
     
    /IF/ Property has a default value
        - Property value = default value
    /ENDIF/
     
    /IF/ Property has a value defined in db at class level
        - Property value = class db value
    /ENDIF/
     
    /IF/ Property has a value defined in db at instance level
        - Property value = instance db value
    /ENDIF/
     
    /IF/ Property still not defined
        - Error
    /ENDIF/

As an example, the following array summarizes the result of this
algorithm. The example is for an IcePap controller and the property is
the port number (called port_number):

==============  ======  ======  ======  ======  ======
                case 1  case 2  case 3  case 4  case 5  
==============  ======  ======  ======  ======  ======
default value   5000    5000    5000    5000            
class in DB                     5150    5150            
inst. in DB             5200            5250            
Property value  5000    5200    5150    5250    Error   
==============  ======  ======  ======  ======  ======


- Case 1: The IcePap controller class defines one property called
  port_number and assigns it a default value of 5000 
- Case 2 : An IcePap controller is created with an instance name
  "My_IcePap". The property IcePap/My_IcePap->port_number has been set
  to 5200 in db 
- Case 3: The hard coded value of 5000 for port number does not fulfill
  the need. A property called IcePap->port_number set to 5150 is defined
  in db. 
- Case 4: We have one instance of IcePap called "My_IcePap" for which we
  have defined a property "IcePap/My_IcePap" set to 5250. 
- Case 5: The IcePap controller has not defined a default value for the
  property. 

In order to provide the user with a friendly interface, all the
properties defined for a controller class have to have informations
hard-coded into the controller class code. We need at least three
informations and sometimes four for each property. They are: 

1. The property name (Mandatory)

2. The property description (Mandatory)

3. The property data type (Mandatory)

4. The property default value (Optional)

With these informations, a graphical user interface is able to build
at controller creation time a panel with the list of all the needed
properties, their descriptions and eventually their default value. The
user then have the possibility to re-define property value if the
default one is not valid for his usage. This is the rule of the
graphical panel to store the new value into the Tango_ database. The
supported data type for controller property are:

==================  ====================================
Property data type  String to use in property definition
==================  ====================================
Boolean             DevBoolean                          
Long                DevLong                             
Double              DevDouble                           
String              DevString                           
Boolean array       DevVarBooleanArray                  
Long array          DevVarLongArray                     
Double array        DevVarDoubleArray                   
String array        DevVarStringArray                   
==================  ====================================

For Python classes (Python controller class), it is possible to define
these properties informations using a Python dictionary called **class_prop** . The property name is the dictionary element key. The dictionary
element value is another dictionary with two or three members which
are the property data type, the property description and an optional
default value. If the data type is an array, the default value has to
be defined in a Python list or tuple. For instance, for our IcePap
port number property, this dictionary will be ::

    class_prop = { "port_number" : { "Type" : "DevLong", "Description",
        "Port on which the IcePap software server is listening", "DefaultValue" : 5000 } }

For C++ controller class, the properties are defined within an array
of **Controller::PropInfo** structures. The name of this array has to be
<Ctrl_class_name>_class_prop. Each Controller::PropInfo structure has
four elements which are all pointers to classical C string (const char
\*). These elements are:

    1. The property name
    2. The property description
    3. The property data type
    4. The property default value (NULL if not used)

A NULL pointer defined the last property. The following is an example
of property definition for a controller class called "DummyController"::

    
    Controller::PropInfo DummyController_class_prop[] = 
    {{"The prop","The first CPP property","DevLong","12"},
     {"Another_Prop","The second CPP property","DevString",NULL},
     {"Third_Prop","The third CPP property","DevVarLongArray","11,22,33"},
     NULL};

The value of these properties is passed to the controller at
controller instance creation time using a constructor parameter. In
Python, this parameter is a dictionnary and the base class of the
controller class will create one object attribute for each property.
In our Python example, the controller will have an attribute called
"port_number" with its value set to 5000. In C++, the controller
contructor receives a vector of **Controller::Properties** structure. Each Controller::Properties structure has two elements
which are: 

    1. The property name as a C++ string
    2. The property value in a **PropData** structure. This PropData structure has four elements which are
        1. A C++ vector of C++ bool type
        2. A C++ vector of C++ long type
        3. A C++ vector of C++ double type
        4. A C++ vector of C++ string.

Only the vector corresponding to the property data type has a size
different than 0. If the property is an array, the vector has as many
elements as the property has. 


The MaxDevice property
""""""""""""""""""""""

Each controller has to have a property defining the maximum number of
device it supports. This is a mandatory requirement. Therefore, in
Python this property is simply defined by setting the value of a
controller data member called **MaxDevice** which will be taken as the default value for the controller. In C++,
you have to define a global variable called
<Ctrl_class_name>_MaxDevice. The management of the number of devices created using a controller
(limited by this property) will be completely done by the pool
software. The information related to this property is automatically
added as first element in the information passed to the controller at
creation time. The following is an example of the definition of this
MaxDevice property in C++ for a controller class called
"DummyController" 



::

    long DummyController_MaxDevice = 16;


C++ controller
""""""""""""""

For C++, the controller code is implemented as a set of classes: A
base class called **Controller** and a class called **MotorController** which inherits from Controller. Finally, the user has to write its
controller class which inherits from MotorController. 


XXX: Unknown layout Subparagraph: The Controller class

11. Controller::CtrlData **MotorController::GetPar** (long axe_number, string &par_name) 
    Get motor parameter value. The CtrlData data type is a structure with
    the following elements

    1. A data type enumeration called data_type describing which of the

    A motor controller has to handle four or five different possible
    values for the "par_name" parameter which are: 
    
    - Acceleration
    
    - Deceleration
    
    - Velocity
    
    - Base_rate
    
    - Backlash which has to be handled only for controller which has the
      backlash feature
    
    The default definition of this method prints a message on the screen
    and returns a NaN double value. 
    
    
12. void **MotorController::SetPar** (long axe_number, string &par_name, Controller::CtrlData &par_value) 
    Set motor parameter value. The default implementation does nothing. A
    motor controller has to handle five or six different value for the
    "par_name" parameter which are:

    - Acceleration
    
    - Deceleration
    
    - Velocity
    
    - Base_rate
    
    - Step_per_unit
    
    - Backlash which has to be handled only for controller which has the
      backlash feature
    
    The description of the CtrlData type is given in the documentation of
    the GetPar() method. The default definition of this method does
    nothing 
    
    
This class has only one constructor which is 

1. **MotorController::MotorController** (const char \*) 
   Constructor of the MotorController class with the controller name as
   instance name

Please, note that this class defines a structure called MotorState
which inherits from the Controller::CtrlState and which has a data
member: 

1. A long describing the motor limit switches state (bit 0 for the Home
   switch, bit 1 for Upper Limit switch and bit 2 for the Lower Limit
   switch)

This structure is used in the StateOne() method. 


XXX: Unknown layout Subparagraph: The user controller class 
XXX: XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \label{par:The-user-controller}:
The user has to implement the remaining pure virtual methods
(AddDevice and DeleteDevice) and has to re-define virtual methods if
the default implementation does not cover his needs. The controller
code has to define two global variables which are: 

1. **Motor_Ctrl_class_name** (for Motor controller). This is an array of classical C strings
   terminated by a NULL pointer. Each array element is the name of a
   Motor controller class defined in this file.

2. **<CtrlClassName>_MaxDevice** . This variable is a long defining the maximum number of device that
   the controller hardware can support.

On top of that, a controller code has to define a C function (defined
as "extern C") which is called by the pool to create instance(s) of
the controller class. This function has the following definition::

    Controller * **_create_<Controller class name>** (const char \*ctrl_instance_name,vector<Controller::Properties> &props)

For instance, for a controller class called DummyController, the name
of this function has to be: _create_DummyController(). The parameters
passed to this function are: 

1. The forth parameter given to the pool during the CreateController
   command (the instance name).

2. A reference to a C++ vector with controller properties as defined in 
   XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{par:Controller-properties}:

The rule of this C function is to create one instance of the user
controller class passing it the arguments it has received. The
following is an example of these definitions 



::

    //
    // Methods of the DummyController controller
    //
    ....
    
    const char *Motor_Ctrl_class_name[] = {"DummyController",NULL};
     
    long DummyController_MaxDevice = 16;
     
    extern "C" {
    Controller *_create_DummyController(const char *inst,vector<Controller::Properties> &prop)
    {
       return new DummyController(inst,prop);
    }
    }

On top of these mandatory definitions, you can define a controller
documentation string, controller properties, controller features and
controller extra features. The documentation string is the first
element of the array returned by the Pool device GetControllerInfo
command as detailed in 
XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{ite:GetControllerInfo:}: 
. It has to be defined as a classical C string (const char \*) with a
name like <Ctrl_class_name>_doc. The following is an example of a
controller C++ code defining all these elements. 



::

    //
    // Methods of the DummyController controller
    //
    ....
    
    const char *Motor_Ctrl_class_name[] = {"DummyController",NULL};
    const char *DummyController_doc = "This is the C++ controller for the DummyController class";
     
    long DummyController_MaxDevice = 16;
     
    char *DummyController_ctrl_extra_features_list[] = {{"Extra_1","DevLong","Read_Write"},
                                                        {"Super_2","DevString","Read"},
                                                        NULL};
    char *DummyController_ctrl_features[] = {"WantRounding","CanDoBacklash",NULL};
     
    Controller::PropInfo DummyController_class_prop[] =
    {{"The prop","The first CPP property","DevLong","12"},
     {"Another_Prop","The second CPP property","DevString",NULL},
     {"Third_Prop","The third CPP property","DevVarLongArray","11,22,33"},
     NULL};
     
    extern "C" {
    Controller *_create_DummyController(const char *inst,vector<Controller::Properties> &prop)
    {
       return new DummyController(inst,prop);
    }
    }


Python controller
"""""""""""""""""

The principle is exactly the same than the one used for C++ controller
but we don't have pure virtual methods with a compiler checking if
they are defined at compile time. Therefore, it is the pool software
which checks that the following methods are defined within the
controller class when the controller module is loaded (imported): 

- AddDevice

- DeleteDevice

- StartOne or StartAll method

- ReadOne method

- StateOne method

With Python controller, there is no need for function to create
controller class instance. With the help of the Python C API, the pool
device is able to create the needed instances. Note that the
StateOne() method does not have the same signature for Python
controller. 

1. tuple **Stat** e **One** (self,axe_number) 
   Get a motor state. The method has to return a tuple with two or three
   elements which are:

    1. The motor state (as defined by Tango)
    
    2. The limit switch state (integer with bit 0 for Home switch, bit 1 for
       Upper switch and bit 2 for Lower switch)
    
    3. A string describing the motor fault if the controller has this
       feature.
    
    
A Python controller class has to inherit from a class called **MotorController** . This does not add any feature but allow the pool software to realize
that this class is a motor controller.

Defining available controller features
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Four data types and two read_write modes are available for the
attribute associated with controller features. The possible data type
are: 

- BOOLEAN

- LONG

- DOUBLE

- STRING

The read_write modes are: 

- READ

- READ_WRITE

All the attributes created to deal with controller features and
defined as READ_WRITE will be memorized attributes. This means that
the attribute will be written with the memorized value just after the
device creation by the Tango_ layer. The definition of a controller
features means defining three elements which are the feature name, the
feature data type and the feature read_write mode. It uses a C++
structure called MotorFeature with three elements which are a C string
(const char \*) for the feature name and two enumeration for the
feature data type and feature read_write mode. All the available
features are defined as an array of these structures in a file called **MotorFeatures.h** 


Controller access when creating a motor
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When you create a motor (a new one or at Pool startup time), the calls
executed on the controller depend if a command "SaveConfig" has
already been executed for this motor. If the motor is new and the
command SaveConfig has never been executed for this motor, the
following controller methods are called: 

1. The AddDevice() method

2. The SetPar() method for the Step_per_unit parameter

3. The GetPar() method for the Velocity parameter

4. The GetPar() method for the Acceleration parameter

5. The GetPar() method for the Deceleration parameter

6. The GetPar() method for the Base_rate parameter

If the motor is not new and if a SaveConfig command has been executed
on this motor, during Pool startup sequence, the motor will be created
and the following controller methods will be called: 

1. The AddDevice() method

2. The SetPar() method for the Step_per_unit parameter

3. The SetPar() method for the Velocity parameter

4. The SetPar() method for the Acceleration parameter

5. The SetPar() method for the Deceleration parameter

6. The SetPar() method for the Base_rate parameter

7. The SetExtraAttributePar() method for each of the memorized motor
   extra attributes


The pool motor group interface
------------------------------

The motor group interface allows the user to move several motor(s) at
the same time. It supports several attributes and commands. It is
implemented in C++ and is mainly a set of controller methods call or
individual motor call. The motor group interface is statically linked
with the Pool device server. When creating a group, the user can
define as group member three kinds of elements which are : 

1. A simple motor

2. Another already created group

3. A pseudo-motor

Nevertheless, it is not possible to have several times the same
physical motor within a group. Therefore, each group has a logical
structure (the one defined by the user when the group is created) and
a physical structure (the list of physical motors really used in the
group). 


The states
^^^^^^^^^^

The motor group interface knows four states which are ON, MOVING,
ALARM and FAULT. A motor group device is in MOVING state when one of
the group element is in MOVING state. It is in ALARM state when one of
the motor is in ALARM state (The underlying motor has reached one of
the limit switches). A motor group device is in FAULT state as long as
any one of the underlying motor is in FAULT state. 


The commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The motor interface supports 1 command on top of the Tango_ Init, State
and Status command. This command is summarized in the following table:

============  ===============  ================
Command name  Input data type  Output data type
============  ===============  ================
Abort         void             void            
============  ===============  ================

- **Abort** : It aborts a running motion. This command does not have input or
  output argument. It aborts the motion of the motor(s) member of the
  group which are still moving while the command is received.


The attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The motor group supports the following attributes:

========  ==============================  ===========  ========
Name      Data type                       Data format  Writable
========  ==============================  ===========  ========
Position  Tango::DevVarDoubleStringArray  Spectrum     R/W     
========  ==============================  ===========  ========

- P **osition** : This is a read/write spectrum of double attribute. Each spectrum
  element is the position of one motor. The order of this array is the
  order used when the motor group has been created. The size of this
  spectrum has to be the size corresponding to the motor number when the
  group is created. For instance, for a group created with 2 motors,
  another group of 3 motors and one pseudo-motor, the size of this
  spectrum when written has to be 6 ( 2 + 3 + 1)


The properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each motor group has 6 properties. Five of them are automatically
managed by the pool software and must not be changed by the user.
These properties are called Motor_group_id, Pool_device, Motor_list,
User_group_elt and Pos_spectrum_dim_x. The last property called
Sleep_bef_last_read is a user property.This user property is:

======================  =============
Property name           Default value
======================  =============
Sleep_bef_last_read     0
======================  =============

It defines the time in milli-second that the software managing a motor
group motion will wait between it detects the end of the motion of the
last group element and the last group motors position reading. 


Getting motor group state using event
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The simplest way to know if a motor group is moving is to survey its
state. If the group is moving, its state will be MOVING. When the
motion is over, its state will be back to ON. The pool motor interface
allows client interested by group state to use the Tango_ event system
subscribing to motor group state change event. As soon as a group
starts a motion, its state is changed to MOVING and an event is sent.
As soon as the motion is over, the group state is updated ans another
event is sent. Events will also be sent to each motor element of the
group when they start moving and when they stop. These events could be
sent before before the group state change event is sent in case of
group motion with different motor motion for each group member. 


Reading the group position attribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each motor group, the key attribute is its position. Special care
has been taken on this attribute management. When the motor group is
not moving (None of the motor are moving), reading the Position
attribute will generate calls to the controller(s) and therefore
hardware access. When the motor group is moving (At least one of its
motor is moving), its position is automatically read every 100 milli-
seconds and stored in the Tango_ polling buffer. This means that a
client reading motor group Position attribute while the group is
moving will get the position from the Tango_ polling buffer and will
not generate extra controller calls. It is also possible to get a
group position using the Tango_ event system. When the group is moving,
an event is sent to the registered clients when the change event
criterion is true. By default, this change event criterion is set to
be a difference in position of 5. It is tunable on a group basis using
the classical group Position attribute "abs_change" property or at the
pool device basis using its DefaultMotGrpPos_AbsChange property.
Anyway, not more than 10 events could be sent by second. Once the
motion is over (None of the motors within the group are moving), the
group position is made unavailable from the Tango_ polling buffer and
is read a last time after a tunable waiting time (Sleep_bef_last_read
property). A forced change event with this value is sent to clients
using events. 


The ghost motor group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to allow pool client software to be entirely event based,
some kind of polling has to be done on each motor to inform them on
state change which are not related to motor motion. To achieve this
goal, one internally managed motor group is created. Each pool motor
is a member of this group. The Tango_ polling thread polls the state
command of this group (Polling period tunable with the pool
Ghostgroup_PollingPeriod property). The code of this group state
command detects change in every motor state and send a state change
event on the corresponding motor. This motor group is not available to
client and is even not defined in the Tango_ database. This is why it
is called the ghost group. 


The pool pseudo motor interface
-------------------------------

The pseudo motor interface acts like an abstraction layer for a motor
or a set of motors allowing the user to control the experiment by
means of an interface which is more meaningful to him(her). 

Each pseudo motor is represented by a C++ written tango device whose
interface allows for the control of a single position (scalar value). 

In order to translate the motor positions into pseudo positions and
vice versa, calculations have to be performed. The device pool
provides a python API class that can be overwritten to provide new
calculations. 


The states
^^^^^^^^^^

The pseudo motor interface knows four states which are ON, MOVING,
ALARM and FAULT. A pseudo motor device is in MOVING state when at
least one motor is in MOVING state. It is in ALARM state when one of
the motor is in ALARM state (The underlying motor has reached one of
the limit switches. A pseudo motor device is in FAULT state as long as
any one of the underlying motor is in FAULT state). 


The commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The pseudo motor interface supports 1 command on top of the Tango
Init, State and Status commands. This command is summarized in the
following table:

============  ===============  ================
Command name  Input data type  Output data type  
============  ===============  ================
Abort         void             void              
============  ===============  ================

- **Abort** : It aborts a running movement. This command does not have input or
  output argument. It aborts the movement of the motor(s) member of the
  pseudo motor which are still moving while the command is received.


The attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The pseudo motor supports the following attributes:

========  ================  ===========  ========
Name      Data type         Data format  Writable  
========  ================  ===========  ========
Position  Tango::DevDouble  Scalar       R/W       
========  ================  ===========  ========

- **Position** : This is read-write scalar double attribute. With the classical Tango
  min and max_value, it is easy to define authorized limit for this
  attribute. It is not allowed to read or write this attribute when the
  pseudo motor is in FAULT or UNKNOWN state. It is also not possible to
  write this attribute when the motor is already MOVING.


The PseudoMotor system class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This chapter describes how to write a valid python pseudo motor system
class. 


Prerequisites
"""""""""""""

Before writing the first python pseudo motor class for your device
pool two checks must be performed: 

1. The device pool **PoolPath** property must exist and must point to the directory which will contain
   your python pseudo motor module. The syntax of this PseudoPath
   property is the same used in the PATH or PYTHONPATH environment
   variables. Please see 
   XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:PoolPath}: 
   for more information on setting this property

2. A PseudoMotor.py file is part of the device pool distribution and is
   located in <device pool home dir>/py_pseudo. This directory must be in
   the PYTHONPATH environment variable or it must be part of the **PoolPath** device pool property metioned above


Rules
"""""

A correct pseudo motor system class must obey the following rules: 

1. the python class PseudoMotor of the PseudoMotor module must be
   imported into the current namespace by using one of the python import
   statements:

    
    
    ::
    
        from PseudoMotor import *
        import PseudoMotor or
        from PseudoMotor import PseudoMotor or
    
    
2. the pseudo motor system class being written must be a subclass of the
   PseudoMotor class (see example below)

3. the class variable **motor_roles** must be set to be a tuple of text descriptions containing each motor
   role description. It is crucial that all necessary motors contain a
   textual description even if it is an empty one. This is because the
   number of elements in this tuple will determine the number of required
   motors for this pseudo motor class. The order in which the roles are
   defined is also important as it will determine the index of the motors
   in the pseudo motor system.

4. the class variable **pseudo_motor_roles** must be set if the pseudo motor class being written represents more
   than one pseudo motor. The order in which the roles are defined will
   determine the index of the pseudo motors in the pseudo motor system.
   If the pseudo motor class represents only one pseudo motor then this
   operation is optional. If omitted the value will of pseudo_motor_roles
   will be set to:

    
5. if the pseudo motor class needs some special parameters then the class
   variable parameters must be set to be a dictionary of <parameter name>
   : { <property> : <value> } values where:

    <parameter name> - is a string representing the name of the parameter 
    
    <property> - is one of the following mandatory properties:
    'Description', 'Type'. The 'Default Value' property is optional. 
    
    <value> - is the corresponding value of the property. The
    'Description' can contain any text value. The 'Type' must be one of
    available Tango_ property data types and 'Default Value' must be a
    string containning a valid value for the corresponding 'Type' value. 
    
    
6. the pseudo motor class must implement a **calc_pseudo** method with the following signature:

    
    
    ::
    
        number = calc_pseudo(index, physical_pos, params = None)
    
    The method will receive as argument the index of the pseudo motor for
    which the pseudo position calculation is requested. This number refers
    to the index in the pseudo_motor_roles class variable. 
    
    The physical_pos is a tuple containing the motor positions. 
    
    The params argument is optional and will contain a dictionary of
    <parameter name> : <value>. 
    
    The method body should contain a code to translate the given motor
    positions into pseudo motor positions. 
    
    The method will return a number representing the calculated pseudo
    motor position. 
    
    
7. the pseudo motor class must implement a **calc_physical** method with the following signature:

    
    
    ::
    
        number = calc_physical(index, pseudo_pos, params = None)
    
    The method will receive as argument the index of the motor for which
    the physical position calculation is requested. This number refers to
    the index in the motor_roles class variable. 
    
    The pseudo_pos is a tuple containing the pseudo motor positions. 
    
    The params argument is optional and will contain a dictionary of
    <parameter name> : <value>. 
    
    The method body should contain a code to translate the given pseudo
    motor positions into motor positions. 
    
    The method will return a number representing the calculated motor
    position. 
    
    
8. Optional implementation of **calc_all_pseudo** method with the following signature:

    
    
    ::
    
        ()/[]/number = calc_all_pseudo(physical_pos,params = None)
    
    The method will receive as argument a physical_pos which is a tuple of
    motor positions. 
    
    The params argument is optional and will contain a dictionary of
    <parameter name> : <value>. 
    
    The method will return a tuple or a list of calculated pseudo motor
    positions. If the pseudo motor class represents a single pseudo motor
    then the return value could be a single number. 
    
    
9. Optional implementation of **calc_all_physical** method with the following signature:

    
    
    ::
    
        ()/[]/number = calc_all_physical(pseudo_pos, params = None)
    
    The method will receive as argument a pseudo_pos which is a tuple of
    pseudo motor positions. 
    
    The params argument is optional and will contain a dictionary of
    <parameter name> : <value>. 
    
    The method will return a tuple or a list of calculated motor
    positions. If the pseudo motor class requires a single motor then the
    return value could be a single number. 
    
    
**Note:** The default implementation **calc_all_physical** and **calc_all_pseudo** methods will call calc_physical and calc_pseudo for each motor and
physical motor respectively. Overwriting the default implementation
should only be done if a gain in performance can be obtained. 


Example
^^^^^^^

One of the most basic examples is the control of a slit. The slit has
two blades with one motor each. Usually the user doesn't want to
control the experiment by directly handling these two motor positions
since their have little meaning from the experiments perspective. 


.. image:: /_static/gap_offset.png



Instead, it would be more useful for the user to control the
experiment by means of changing the gap and offset values. Pseudo
motors gap and offset will provide the necessary interface for
controlling the experiments gap and offset values respectively. 

The calculations that need to be performed are: 


\[ \left\{ \begin{array}{l} gap=sl2t+sl2b\\ offset=\frac{sl2t-sl2b}{2}\end{array}\right.\]


\[ \left\{ \begin{array}{l} sl2t=-offset+\frac{gap}{2}\\ sl2b=offset+\frac{gap}{2}\end{array}\right.\]


The corresponding python code would be: 



::

    
    01  class Slit(PseudoMotor):
    02      """A Slit system for controlling gap and offset pseudo motors."""
    04
    05      pseudo_motor_roles = ("Gap", "Offset")
    06      motor_roles = ("Motor on blade 1", "Motor on blade 2")
    07
    08  def calc_physical(self,index,pseudo_pos,params = None):
    09      half_gap = pseudo_pos[0]/2.0
    10      if index == 0:
    11          return -pseudo_pos[1] + half_gap
    12      else
    13          return pseudo_pos[1] + half_gap
    14
    15  def calc_pseudo(self,index,physical_pos,params = None):
    16      if index == 0:
    17          return physical_pos[1] + physical_pos[0]
    18      else:
    19          return (physical_pos[1] - physical_pos[0])/2.0

The Counter/Timer interface
---------------------------


The Counter/Timer user interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Counter/Timer interface is statically linked with the Pool device
server and supports several attributes and commands. It is implemented
in C++ and used a set of the so-called "controller" methods. The
Counter/Timer interface is always the same whatever the hardware is.
This is the rule of the "controller" to access the hardware using the
communication link supported by the hardware (network link, Serial
line...). 

The controller code has a well-defined interface and can be written
using Python or C++. In both cases, it will be dynamically loaded into
the pool device server process. 


The states
""""""""""

The Counter/Timer interface knows four states which are `ON`, *MOVING*,
**FAULT** and UNKNOWN. A Counter/Timer device is in MOVING state when it
is counting! It is in FAULT if its controller software is not
available (impossible to load it), if a fault is reported from the
hardware controller or if the controller software returns an
unforeseen state. The device is in the UNKNOWN state if an exception
occurs during the communication between the pool and the hardware
controller. 


The commands
""""""""""""

The Counter/Timer interface supports 2 commands on top of the Tango
classical Init, State and Status commands. These commands are
summarized in the following table:

============  ===============  ================
Command name  Input data type  Output data type  
============  ===============  ================
Start         void             void              
Stop          void             void              
============  ===============  ================


- **Start** : When the device is used as a counter, this commands allows the
  counter to start counting. When it is used as a timer, this command
  starts the timer. This command changes the device state from ON to
  MOVING. It is not allowed to execute this command if the device is
  already in the MOVING state.

- **Stop** : When the device is used as a counter, this commands stops the
  counter. When it is used as a timer, this command stops the timer.
  This commands changes the device state from MOVING to ON. It is a no
  action command if this command is received and the device is not in
  the MOVING state.


The attributes
""""""""""""""

The Counter/Timer interface supports several attributes which are
summarized in the following table:

==============  =================  ===========  ========  =========  ==========
Name            Data type          Data format  Writable  Memorized  Ope/Expert  
==============  =================  ===========  ========  =========  ==========
Value           Tango::DevDouble   Scalar       R/W       No         Ope         
SimulationMode  Tango::DevBoolean  Scalar       R         No         Ope         
==============  =================  ===========  ========  =========  ==========

- **Value** : This is read-write scalar double attribute. Writing the value is
  used to clear (or to preset) a counter or to set a timer time. For
  counter, reading the value allows the user to get the count number.
  For timer, the read value is the elapsed time since the timer has been
  started. After the acquisition, the value stays unchanged until a new
  count/time is started. For timer, the unit of this attribute is the
  second.

- **SimulationMode** : This is a read only scalar boolean attribute. When set, all the
  counting/timing requests are not forwarded to the software controller
  and then to the hardware. When set, the device Value is always 0. To
  set this attribute, the user has to used the pool device Tango
  interface. It is not allowed to read this attribute when the device is
  in FAULT or UNKNOWN states.


The properties
""""""""""""""

Each Counter/Timer device has one property which is automatically
managed by the pool software and must not be changed by the user. This
property is named Channel_id. 


The Counter/Timer controller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CounterTimer controller follows the same principles already
explained for the Motor controller in chapter 
XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-Motor-Controller}: 



The basic

For Counter/Timer, the pre-defined set of methods which has to be
implemented can be splitted in 7 different types which are: 

1. Methods to create/remove counter/timer experiment channel

2. Methods to get channel(s) state

3. Methods to read channel(s)

4. Methods to load channel(s)

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Two methods are called when creating or removing counter/timer channel
from a controller. These methods are called **AddDevice** and **DeleteDevice** . The AddDevice method is called when a new channel belonging to the
controller is created within the pool. The DeleteDevice method is
called when a channel belonging to the controller is removed from the
pool.

Method(s) to read Counter Timer Experiment Channel
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Four methods are used when a request to read channel(s) value is
received. These methods are called PreReadAll, PreReadOne, ReadAll and
ReadOne. The algorithm used to read value of one or several channels
is the following : 



::

    /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the reading
         - Call PreReadAll()
    /END FOR/
     
    /FOR/ Each channel(s) implied in the reading
         - PreReadOne(channel to read)
    /END FOR/
     
    /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the reading
         - Call ReadAll()
    /END FOR/
     
    /FOR/ Each channel(s) implied in the reading
         - Call ReadOne(channel to read)
    /END FOR/

The following array summarizes the rule of each of these methods:

====================  ================================  =====================================  =================================  =================================================================

This algorithm covers the sophisticated case where a physical
controller is able to read several channels positions at the same
time. For some simpler controller, it is possible to implement only
the ReadOne() method. The default implementation of the three
remaining methods is defined in a way that the algorithm works even in
such a case. 


Method(s) to load Counter Timer Experiment Channel
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Four methods are used when a request to load channel(s) value is
received. These methods are called PreLoadAll, PreLoadOne, LoadAll and
LoadOne. The algorithm used to load value in one or several channels
is the following::

    /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the loading
         - Call PreLoadAll()
    /END FOR/
     
    /FOR/ Each channel(s) implied in the loading
         - ret = PreLoadOne(channel to load,new channel value)
         - /IF/ ret is true
              - Call LoadOne(channel to load, new channel value)
         - /END IF/
    /END FOR/

such a case. 


Method(s) to start Counter Timer Experiment Channel
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Four methods are used when a request to start channel(s) is received.
These methods are called PreStartAllCT, PreStartOneCT, StartAllCT and
StartOneCT. The algorithm used to start one or several channels is the
following::

    /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the starting
         - Call PreStartAllCT()
    /END FOR/
     
    /FOR/ Each channel(s) implied in the starting

C++ controller
""""""""""""""

For C++, the controller code is implemented as a set of classes: A
base class called **Controller** and a class called **CoTiController** which inherits from Controller. Finally, the user has to write its
controller class which inherits from CoTiController. The Controller
class has already been detailed in 
XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-Cpp-Controller-class}: 
. 


XXX: Unknown layout Subparagraph: The CoTiController class
The CoTiController class defines thirteen virtual methods which are:

   The default implementation does nothing

2. void **CoTiController::PreReadOne** (long idx_to_read) 
   The default implementation does nothing

3. void **CoTiController::ReadAll** () 
   The default implementation does nothing

4. double **CoTiController::ReadOne** (long idx_to_read) 
   The default implementation prints a message on the screen and return a

5. void **CoTiController::PreLoadAll** () 
   The default implementation does nothing

6. bool **CoTiController::PreLoadOne** (long idx_to_load,double new_value)

11. void **CoTiController::StartOneCT** (long idx_to_start) 
    The default implementation does nothing

12. void **CoTiController::StartAllCT** () 
    The default implementation does nothing

13. void **CoTiController::AbortOne** (long idx_to_abort) 
    The default implementation does nothing

This class has one constructor which is 

1. **CoTiController::CoTiController** (const char \*) 
   Constructor of the CoTiController class with the controller instance
   name as parameter


XXX: Unknown layout Subparagraph: The user controller class
The user has to implement the remaining pure virtual methods
(AddDevice and DeleteDevice) and has to re-define virtual methods if
the default implementation does not cover his needs. The controller
code has to define two global variables which are: 

1. **CounterTimer_Ctrl_class_name** : This is an array of classical C strings terminated by a NULL
   pointer. Each array element is the name of a Counter Timer Channel
   controller defined in the file.

2. **<CtrlClassName>_MaxDevice** : Idem motor controller definition

On top of that, a controller code has to define a C function to create
the controller object. This is similar to the Motor controller
definition which is documented in 
XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{par:The-user-controller}: 



Python controller
"""""""""""""""""

The principle is exactly the same than the one used for C++ controller
but we don't have pure virtual methods with a compiler checking if
they are defined at compile time. Therefore, it is the pool software
which checks that the following methods are defined within the
controller class when the controller module is loaded (imported): 

- AddDevice

- DeleteDevice

- ReadOne method

- StateOne method

- StartOneCT or StartAllCT method

- LoadOne or LoadAll method

With Python controller, there is no need for function to create
controller class instance. With the help of the Python C API, the pool
device is able to create the needed instances. Note that the
StateOne() method does not have the same signature for Python
controller.

1. tuple **Stat** e **One** (self,idx_number) 
   Get a channel state. The method has to return a tuple with one or two
   elements which are:

    1. The channel state (as defined by Tango)
    
    2. A string describing the motor fault if the controller has this
       feature.
    
    
A Python controller class has to inherit from a class called 
**CounterTimerController** . This does not add any feature but allows the pool
software to realize that this class is a Counter Timer Channel controller.


The Unix Timer
--------------

A timer using the Unix getitimer() and setitimer() system calls is
provided. It is a Counter/Timer C++ controller following the
definition of the previous chapter. Therefore, the device created
using this controller will have the Tango_ interface as the one
previously described. 

The Unix Timer controller shared library is called **UxTimer.so** and the 
Controlller class is called **UnixTimer** . This controller is foresee to 
have only one device (MaxDevice = 1) 


The ZeroDExpChannel interface
-----------------------------

The ZeroDExpChannel is used to access any kind of device which returns
a scalar value and which are not counter or timer. Very often (but not
always), this is a commercial measurement equipment connected to a
GPIB bus. In order to have a precise as possible measurement, an
acquisition loop is implemented for these ZeroDExpChannel device. This
acquisition loop will simply read the data from the hardware as fast
as it can (only "sleeping" 20 mS between each reading) and a
computation is done on the resulting data set to return only one
value. Three types of computation are foreseen. The user selects which
one he needs with an attribute. The time during which this acquisition
loop will get data is also defined by an attribute 


The ZeroDExpChannel user interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ZeroDExpChannel interface is statically linked with the Pool
device server and supports several attributes and commands. It is
implemented in C++ and used a set of the so-called "controller"
methods. The ZeroDExpChannel interface is always the same whatever the
hardware is. This is the rule of the "controller" to access the
hardware using the communication link supported by the hardware
(network link, GPIB...). 

The controller code has a well-defined interface and can be written
using Python or C++. In both cases, it will be dynamically loaded into
the pool device server process. 


The states
""""""""""

The ZeroDExpChannel interface knows five states which are ON, MOVING,
ALARM, FAULT and UNKNOWN. A ZeroDExpChannel device is in MOVING state
when it is acquiring data! It is in ALARM state when at least one
error has occured during the last acquisition. It is in FAULT if its
controller software is not available (impossible to load it), if a
fault is reported from the hardware controller or if the controller
software returns an unforeseen state. The device is in the UNKNOWN
state if an exception occurs during the communication between the pool
and the hardware controller. 


The commands
""""""""""""

The ZeroDExpChannel interface supports 2 commands on top of the Tango
classical Init, State and Status commands. These commands are
summarized in the following table:

============  ===============  ================
Command name  Input data type  Output data type  
============  ===============  ================
Start         void             void              
Stop          void             void              
============  ===============  ================

- **Start** : Start the acquisition for the time defined by the attribute
  CumulatedTime. If the CumulatedTime attribute value is 0, the
  acquisition will not automatically stop until a Stop command is
  received. This command changes the device state from ON to MOVING. It
  is not allowed to execute this command if the device is already in the
  MOVING state.

- **Stop** : Stop the acquisition. This commands changes the device state from
  MOVING to ON. It is a no action command if this command is received
  and the device is not in the MOVING state.


The attributes
""""""""""""""

The ZeroDExpChannel interface supports several attributes which are
summarized in the following table:

=====================  =================  ===========  ========  =========  ==========
Name                   Data type          Data format  Writable  Memorized  Ope/Expert  
=====================  =================  ===========  ========  =========  ==========
Value                  Tango::DevDouble   Scalar       R         No         Ope         
CumulatedValue         Tango::DevDouble   Scalar       R         No         Ope         
CumulationTime         Tango::DevDouble   Scalar       R/W       Yes        Ope         
CumulationType         Tango::DevLong     Scalar       R/W       Yes        Ope         
CumulatedPointsNumber  Tango::DevLong     Scalar       R         No         Ope         
CumulatedPointsError   Tango::DevLong     Scalar       R         No         Ope         
SimulationMode         Tango::DevBoolean  Scalar       R         No         Ope         
=====================  =================  ===========  ========  =========  ==========

- **Value** : This is read scalar double attribute. This is the live value reads
  from the hardware through the controller

- **CumulatedValue** : This is a read scalar double attribute. This is the result of the
  data acquisition after the computation defined by the CumulationType
  attribute has been applied. This value is 0 until an acquisition has
  been started. After an acquisition, the attribute value stays
  unchanged until the next acquisition is started. If during the
  acquisition some error(s) has been received while reading the data,
  the attribute quality factor will be set to ALARM

- **CumulationTime** : This is a read-write scalar double and memorized attribute. This is
  the acquisition time in seconds. The acquisition will automatically
  stops after this CumulationTime. Very often, reading the hardware
  device to get one data is time-consuming and it is not possible to
  read the hardware a integer number of times within this
  CumulationTime. A device property called StopIfNoTime (see 
  XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{ite:StopIfNoTime:-A-boolean}: 
  ) allows the user to tune the acquisition loop.

- **CumulationType** : This a read-write scalar long and memorized attribute. Defines the
  computation type done of the values gathered during the acquisition.
  Three type of computation are supported:

    1. Sum: The CumulatedValue attribute is the sum of all the data read
       during the acquisition. This is the default type.
    
    2. Average: The CumulatedValue attribute is the average of all the data
       read during the acquisition
    
    3. Integral: The CumulatedValue attribute is a type of the integral of
       all the data read during the acquisition
    
    
- **CumulatedPointsNumber** : This is a read scalar long attribute. This is the number of data
  correctly read during the acquisition. The attribute value is 0 until
  an acquisition has been started and stay unchanged between the end of
  the acquisition and the start of the next one.

- **CumulatedPointsError** : This is a read scalar long attribute. This is the number of times it
  was not possible to read the data from the hardware due to error(s).
  The property ContinueOnError allows the user to define what to do in
  case of error. The attribute value is 0 until an acquisition has been
  started and stay unchanged between the end of the acquisition and the
  start of the next one.

- **SimulationMode** : This is a read only scalar boolean attribute. When set, all the
  acquisition requests are not forwarded to the software controller and
  then to the hardware. When set, the device Value, CumulatedValue,
  CumulatedPointsNumber and CumulatedPointsError are always 0. To set
  this attribute, the user has to used the pool device Tango_ interface.
  The value of the CumulationTime and CumulationType attributes are
  memorized at the moment this attribute is set. When this mode is
  turned off, if the value of any of the previously memorized attributes
  has changed, it is reapplied to the memorized value. It is not allowed
  to read this attribute when the device is in FAULT or UNKNOWN states.


The properties
""""""""""""""

Each ZeroDExpChannel device has a set of properties. One of these
properties is automatically managed by the pool software and must not
be changed by the user. This property is named Channel_id. The user
properties are: 

===============  =============
Property name    Default value  
===============  =============
StopIfNoTime     true           
ContinueOnError  true           
===============  =============

- XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \label{ite:StopIfNoTime:-A-boolean}: 
  **StopIfNoTime** : A boolean property. If this property is set to true, the acquisition
  loop will check before acquiring a new data that it has enough time to
  do this. To achieve this, the acquisition loop measures the time
  needed by the previous data read and checks that the actual time plus
  the acquisition time is still less than the CumulationTime. If not,
  the acquisition stops. When this property is set to false, the
  acquisition stops when the acquisition time is greater or equal than
  the CumulationTime

- **ContinueOnError** : A boolean property. If this property is set to true (the default),
  the acquisition loop continues reading the data even after an error
  has been received when trying to read data. If it is false, the
  acquisition stops as soon as an error is detected when trying to read
  data from the hardware.


Getting ZeroDExpChannel state using event
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The simplest way to know if a Zero D Experiment Channel is acquiring
data is to survey its state. If the device is acquiring data, its
state will be MOVING. When the acquisition is over, its state will be
back to ON. The pool ZeroDExpChannel interface allows client
interested by Experiment Channel state value to use the Tango_ event
system subscribing to channel state change event. As soon as a channel
starts an acquisition, its state is changed to MOVING and an event is
sent. As soon as the acquisition is over (for one reason or another),
the channel state is updated and another event is sent. 


XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \label{par:Reading-the-ZeroDExpChannel}:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Reading the ZeroDExpChannel CumulatedValue attribute

During an acquisition, events with CumulatedValue attribute are sent
from the device server to the interested clients. The acquisition loop
will periodically read this event and fire an event. The first and the
last events fired during the acquisition loop do not check the change
event criteria. The other during the acquisition loop check the change
event criteria

Methods to create/remove Zero D Experiment Channel
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Two methods are called when creating or removing experiment channel
from a controller. These methods are called **AddDevice** and **DeleteDevice** . The AddDevice method is called when a new channel belonging to the
controller is created within the pool. The DeleteDevice method is
called when a channel belonging to the controller is removed from the
pool.

These methods follow the same definition than the one defined for
Motor controller which are detailed in chapter 
XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{par:Methods-to-get-state}:

Method(s) to read Zero D Experiment Channel
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Four methods are used when a request to read channel(s) value is
received. These methods are called PreReadAll, PreReadOne, ReadAll and
ReadOne. The algorithm used to read value of one or several channels
is the following::

    /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the reading
         - Call PreReadAll()
    /END FOR/
     
    /FOR/ Each channel(s) implied in the reading
         - PreReadOne(channel to read)
    /END FOR/
     
    /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the reading
         - Call ReadAll()
    /END FOR/
     
    /FOR/ Each channel(s) implied in the reading
         - Call ReadOne(channel to read)
    /END FOR/

The following array summarizes the rule of each of these methods:

This algorithm covers the sophisticated case where a physical
controller is able to read several channels positions at the same
time. For some simpler controller, it is possible to implement only
the ReadOne() method. The default implementation of the three
remaining methods is defined in a way that the algorithm works even in
such a case.

The rule of these methods is to 

- Get or Set channel extra attribute(s) parameter with methods called
  GetExtraAttributePar() or SetExtraAttributePar()

For C++, the controller code is implemented as a set of classes: A
base class called **Controller** and a class called **ZeroDController** which inherits from Controller. Finally, the user has to write its

The Measurement Group interface
-------------------------------

The measurement group interface allows the user to access several data
acquisition channels at the same time. It is implemented as a C++
Tango_ device that is statically linked with the Pool device server. It
supports several attributes and commands. 

The measurement group is the key interface to be used when getting
data. The Pool can have several measurement groups but only one will
be 'in use' at a time. When creating a measurement group, the user can
define four kinds of channels which are: 

1. Counter/Timer

2. ZeroDExpChannel

3. OneDExpChannel

4. TwoDExpChannel

In order to properly use the measurement group, one of the channels
has to be defined as the timer or the monitor. It is not possible to
have several times the same channel in a measurement group. It is also
not possible to create two measurement groups with exactly the same
channels. 


The States
^^^^^^^^^^

The measurement group interface knows five states which are ON,
MOVING, ALARM, FAULT. A group is in MOVING state when it is acquiring
data (which means that the timer/monitor channel is in MOVING state).
A STANDBY state means that the group is not the current active group
of the Pool it belongs to. An ON state means that the group is ready
to be used. ALARM means that no timer or monitor are defined for the
group. If at least one of the channels reported a FAULT by the
controller(s) of that(those) channel(s), the group will be in FAULT
state. 


The commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The measurement group interface supports three commands on top of the
Tango_ Init, State and Status commands. These commands are summarized
in the following table:

================  ===============  ================
Command name      Input data type  Output data type  
================  ===============  ================
Start             void             void              
Abort             void             void              
AddExpChannel     String           void              
RemoveExpChannel  String           void              
================  ===============  ================

- **Start** : When the device is in timer mode (Integration_time attribute > 0),
  it will start counting on all channels at the same time until the
  timer channel reaches a value of the Integration_time attribute. When
  the device in in monitor mode (Integration_count attribute > 0), it
  will start counting on all channels at the same time until de monitor
  channel reaches the value of the Integration_count attribute. For more
  details on setting the acquisition mode see 
  XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{Measurement Group: The attributes}: 
  . This command will change the device state to MOVING. It will not be
  allowed to execute this command if the device is already in MOVING
  state. This command does not have any input or output arguments. The
  state will change from MOVING to ON only when the last channel reports
  that its acquisition has finished.

- **Abort** : It aborts the running data acquisition. It will stop each channel
  member of the measurement group. This command does not have any input
  or output arguments.

- **AddExpChannel** : adds a new experiment channel to the measurement group. The given
  string argument must be a valid experiment channel in the pool and
  must not be one of the channels of the measurement group. An event
  will be sent on the corresponding attribute representing the list of
  channels in the measurement group. For example, if the given channel
  is a Counter/Timer channel, then an event will be sent for the
  attribute "Counters "(See below for a list of attributes in the measurement group).

- **RemoveExpChannel** : removes the given channel from the measurement group. The given
  string argument must be a valid experiment channel in the measurement
  group. If the channel to be deleted is the current Timer/Monitor then
  the value for the corresponding attribute will be set to "Not Initialized "and an event will be sent. An event will be sent on the corresponding
  attribute representing the list of channels in the measurement group.

- **Integration_time** : The group timer integration time. Setting this value to >0 will set
  the measurement group acquisition mode to timer. It will force
  Integration_count attribute to 0 (zero). It will also exclude the
  current Timer channel from the list of Counters. Units are in seconds.

- **Integration_count** : The group monitor count value. Setting this value to >0 will set the
  measurement group acquisition mode change to monitor. It will force
  Integration_time attribute to 0 (zero).

- **Timer** : The name of the channel used as a Timer. A "Not Initialized "value means no timer is defined

- **Monitor** : The name of the channel used as a Monitor. A "Not Initialized "value means no timer is defined

- **Counter** : The list of counter names in the group

- **ZeroDExpChannels** : The list of 0D Experiment channel names in the group

- **OneDExpChannels** : The list of 1D Experiment channel names in the group

- **TwoDExpChannels** : The list of 2D Experiment channel names in the group

- **<channel_name** _{\text{i}} **>_Value** : (with 0\leq i<n ) attributes dynamically created (one for each channel) which will
  contain the corresponding channel Value(for Counter/Timer, 1D or
  2DExpChannels), CumulatedValue(for 0DExpChannels). For Counter/Timers
  and 0DExpChannels the data format will be Scalar. For 1DExpChannels it
  will be Spectrum and for 2DExpChannels it will be Image.


The properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Device properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each measurement group has five properties. All of them are managed
automatically by the pool software and must not be changed by the
user. These properties are called Measurement_group_id, Pool_device,
CT_List, ZeroDExpChannel_List, OneDExpChannel_List,
TwoDExpChannel_List. 




XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \label{measurement group:Checking-operation-modes}:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Checking operation mode

Currently, the measurement group supports two operation modes. The
table below shows how to determine the current mode for a measurement
group. 


=======  ================  =================
mode     Integration_time  Integration_count  
=======  ================  =================
Timer    >0.0              0                  
Monitor  0.0               >0                 
Undef    0.0               0                  
=======  ================  =================



'Undef' means no valid values are defined in Integration_time and in
Integration_count. You will not be able to execute the Start command
in this mode. 


Getting measurement group state using event
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The simplest way to know if a measurement group is acquiring data is
to survey its state. If a measurement group is acquiring data its
state will be MOVING. When the data acquisition is over, its state
will change back to ON. The data acquisition is over when the
measurement group detects that all channels finished acquisition
(their state changed from MOVING to ON).The pool group interface
allows clients interested in group state to use the Tango_ event system
subscribing to measurement group state change event. As soon as a
group starts acquiring data, its state is changed to MOVING and an
event is sent. A new event will be sent when the data acquisition
ends. Events will also be sent to each channel of the group when they
start acquiring data and when they stop. 


Reading the measurement group channel values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each measurement group there is a set of key dynamic attributes
representing the value of each channel in the group. They are named
<channel_name _{\text{i}} >_Value. Special care has been taken on the management of these
attributes with distinct behavior depending on the type of channel the
attribute represents (Counter/Timer, 0D, 1D or 2D channel). 


Counter/Timer channel values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Counter/Timer Value is represented by a scalar read-only double
attribute. When the measurement group is not taking data, reading the
counter/timer value will generate calls to the controller and
therefore hardware access. When the group is taking data (master
channel is moving), the value of a counter/timer is read every 100
miliseconds and stored in the Tango_ polling buffer. This means that a
client reading the value of the channel while the group is moving will
get the value from the Tango_ polling buffer and will not generate exra
controller calls. It is also possible to get the value using the Tango
event system. When the group is moving, an event is sent to the
registered clients when the change event criteria is true. This is
applicable for each Counter/Timer channel in the group. By default,
this change event criterion is set to be an absolute difference in the
value of 5.0. It is tunable by attribute using the classical "abs_change "property or the pool device basis using its defaultCtGrpVal_AbsChange
property. Anyway, not more than 10 events could be sent by second.
Once the data acquisition is over, the value is made unavailable from
the Tango_ polling buffer and is read a last time. A forced change
event is sent to clients using events. 


Zero D channel values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ZeroDExpChannel CumulatedValue is represented by a scalar read-only
double attribute. Usually a ZeroDChannel represents the value of a
single device (ex.: multimeter). Therefore, has hardware access cannot
be optimized for a group of devices, reading the value on the
measurement group device attribute has exactly the same behavior as
reading it directly on the CumulatedValue attribute of the
ZeroDChannel device (see 
XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{par:Reading-the-ZeroDExpChannel}: 
). 


One D channel values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two D channel values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To be filled in 


Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^

Measurement group devices can often contain many channels. Client
applications often request channel values for the set (or subset) of
channels in a group. Read requests for these channel values through
the <channel_name _{\text{i}} >_Value attributes of a measurement group should be done by clients in
groups as often as possible. This can be achieved by using the client
Tango_ API call read_attributes on a DeviceProxy object. This will
ensure maximum performance by minimizing hardware access since the
measurement group can order channel value requests per controller thus
avoiding unecessary calls to the hardware. 


Measurement group configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Timer/Monitor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Measurement group operation mode can be checked/set through the
Integration_time and Integration_count (see 
XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{measurement group:Checking-operation-modes}: 
). Setting the Integration_time to >0.0 will make the data acquisition
(initiated by the invoking the Start command) finish when the channel
defined in the Timer attribute reaches the value of Integration_time.
Setting the Integration_count to >0 will make the data acquisition
(initiated by the invoking the Start command) finish when the channel
defined in the Monitor attribute reaches the value of
Integration_count. 

In either case, the measurement group will NOT assume that the master
channel(timer/monitor) is able to stop all the other channels in the
group, so it will force a Stop on these channels as soon as it detects
that the master has finished. This is the case of the UnixTimer
channel which itself has no knowledge of the channels involved and
therefore is not able to stop them directly. 

Integration_time, Integration_count, timer and monitor are memorized
attributes. This means that the configuration values of these
attributes are stored in the database. The next time the Pool starts
the values are restored. This is done in order to reduce Pool
configuration at startup to the minimum. 


The ghost measurement group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to allow pool client software to be entirely event based,
some kind of polling has to be done on each channel to inform them on
state change which are not related to data acquisition. To achieve
this goal, one internally managed measurement group is created. Each
pool channel (counter/timer, 0D, 1D or 2D experiment channel) is a
member of this group. The Tango_ polling thread polls the state command
of this group (Polling period tunable with the pool
Ghostgroup_PollingPeriod property). The code of this group state
command detects change in every channel state and send a state change
event on the corresponding channel. This measurment group is not
available to client and is even not defined in the Tango_ database.
This is why it is called the ghost measurement group.

Common task handled by the pool
===============================


Constraint
----------

Two types of constraint are identified. 

1. Simple constraint: This type of constraint is valid only for motor
   motion. It limits motor motion. This in not the limit switches which
   are a hardware protection. It's a software limit. This type of
   constraint is managed by the min_value and max_value property of the
   motor Position Tango_ attribute. Tango_ core will refused to write the
   attribute (Position) if outside the limits set by these min_value and
   max_value attribute properties. These values are set on motor Position
   attribute in physical unit. 
   **Warning** : The backlash has to be taken into account in the management of this
   limit. In order to finish the motion always coming from the same
   direction, sometimes the motor has to go a little bit after the wanted
   position and then returns to the desired position. The limit value has
   to take the backlash value into account. If the motor backlash
   attribute is modified, it will also change the Position limit value.
   
   .. image:: /_static/limit.png
   
2. User constraint: This kind of constraint is given to the user to allow
   him to write constraint macros which will be executed to allow or
   disallow an action to be done on one object. In the pool case, the
   object is a writable attribute and the action is writing the
   attribute. Therefore, the following algorithm is used when writing an
   attribute with constraint:



::

    /IF/ Simple constraint set
       /IF/ New value outside limits
           - Throw an exception
       /ENDIF/
    /ENDIF/
     
    /IF/ Some user constraint associated to this attribute
       /FOR/ All the user constraint
          - Evaluate the constraint
          /IF/ The constraint evaluates to False
              - Throw an exception
          /ENDIF/
       /ENDFOR/
    /ENDIF/
     
    - Write the attribute

The first part of this algorithm is part of the Tango_ core. The second
part will be coded in the Pool Tango_ classes and in a first phase will
be available only for the Position attribute of the Motor class. 


User constraint implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the user creates a constraint, he has to provide to the pool the
following information: 

1. The name of the object to which the constraint belongs. It is the name
   of the writable Tango_ attribute (actually only a motor position
   attribute.

A user constraint will be written using the Python language. It has to
be a Python class with a constructor and a "Evaluate" method. This
class has to inherit from a class called PoolConstraint. This will
allow the pool software to dynamically discover that this class is a
pool constraint. The class may define the depending
attributes/devices. A depending attribute/device is an object used to
evaluate if the constraint is true or false. The depending attributes
have to be defined in a list called **depending_attr_list** . Each element in this list is a dictionnary with up to 2 elements
which are the description of the depending attribute and eventually a
default value. The depending devices have to be defined in a list
called **depending_dev_list** which follow the same syntax than the depending_attr_list. A
constraint may also have properties as defined in 
XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{par:Controller-properties}: 
. The constructor will receive three input arguments which are: 

1. A list with the depending attribute name

2. A list with the depending device name

3. A dictionnary (name:value) with the properties definition

One rule of the constructor is to build the connection with these
Tango_ objects and to keep them in the instance. The Evaluate method
will evaluate the constraint and will return true or false. It
receives as input argument a list with the result of a read_attribute
call executed on all the depending attributes. 

Five pool device commands and two attribute allow the management of
these constraints. The commands are **CreateConstraint** , **DeleteConstraint** , **EvaluateContraint, GetConstraintClassInfo** and **GetConstraint** . The attributes are called **ConstraintList** and **ConstraintClassList** . They are all detailed in chapters 
XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Device-pool-commands}: 
and 
XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Device-pool-attributes}: 
. The following is an example of a user constraint 




::

    3 class MyConstraint(PoolConstraint):
    4 
    5    depending_attr_list = [{'DefaultValue':"first_mot/position",

Archiving motor position
------------------------

XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Archiving-motor-position}:

It is not possible to archive motor position using the Tango_ memorized
attribute feature because Tango_ writes the attribute value into the
database just after it has been set by the user. In case of motors
which need some time to go to the desired value and which from time to
time do not go exactly to the desired value (for always possible to
have position which is a integer number of motor steps), it is more
suited to store the motor position at the end of the motion. To
achieve this, the pool has a command (called **ArchieveMotorPosition** ) which will store new motor positions into the database. This command
will be polled by the classical Tango_ polling thread in order to
execute it regularly. The algorithm used by this command is the
following: 



::

    - Read motors position for all motors which are not actually moving
     
    - /FOR/ all motors
        - /IF/ The new position just read is different than the old one
           - Mark the motor as storable
        - /ENDIF/
    - /ENDFOR/
     
    - Store in DB position of all storable motors
    - Memorize motors position

In order to minimize the number of calls done on the Tango_ database,
we need to add to the Tango_ database software the ability to store x
properties of one attribute of y devices into the database in one call
(or may be simply the same property of one attribute of several
device).

The pool device Tango_ interface
=================================

The pool is implemented as a C++ Tango_ device server and therefore
supports a set of commands/attributes. It has several attributes to
get object (motor, pseudo-motor, controller) list. These lists are
managed as attributes in order to have events on them when a new
object (motor, controller...) is created/deleted. 


Device pool commands
--------------------

XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Device-pool-commands}:

On top of the three classical Tango_ commands (State, Status and Init),
the pool device supports the commands summarized in the following

==================  ======================  ============================  ========================

- **CreateController** : This command creates a controller object. It has four arguments (all
  strings) which are:

    1. The controller device type: Actually three types are supported as
       device type. They are:
    
        - "Motor" (case independent) for motor device
        
        - "CounterTimer" (case independent) for counter timer device
        
        - "ZeroDExpChannel" (case independent) for zero dimension experiment
          channel device
        
        
    2. Controller code file name: For C++ controller, this is the name of the
       controller shared library file. For Python controller, this is the
       name of the controller module. This parameter is only a file name, not
       a path. The path is automatically taken from the pool device **PooPath** property. It is not necessary to change your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
       PYTHONPATH environment variable. Everything is taken from the PoolPath
       property.
    
    3. Controller class name: This is the name of the class implementing the
       controller. This class has to be implemented within the controller
       shared library or Python module passed as previous argument
    
    4. Instance name: It is a string which allows the device pool to deal
       with several instance of the same controller class. The pool checks
       that this name is uniq within a control system.
    
    
The list of created controllers is kept in one of the pool device
property and at next startup time, all controllers will be
automatically re-created. If you have several pool device within a
control system (the same TANGO_HOST), it is not possible to have two
times the same controller defines on different pool device. Even if
the full controller name is <Controller file name>.<Controller class
name>/<Instance name>, each created controller has an associated name
which is:

    <Instance name>
    
which has to be used when the controller name is requested. This name
is case independent.

- **DeleteController** : This command has only one input argument which is the controller
  name (as defined previously). It is not possible to delete a
  controller with attached device(s). You first have to delete
  controller's device(s).

- **InitController** : This command is used to (re)-initialize a controller if the
  controller initialization done at pool startup time has failed. At
  startup time, the device pool creates controller devices even if the
  controller initialization has failed. All controller devices are set
  to the FAULT state. This command will try to re-create the controller
  object and if successful, send an "Init" command to every controller
  devices. Its input argument is the controller name.

- **GetControllerInfo** : This command has three or four input parameters which are: 
  XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \label{ite:GetControllerInfo:}:

    1. The controller device type
    
    2. The controller code file name: For C++ controller, this is the name of
       the controller shared library file. For Python controller, this is the
       name of the controller module. This parameter is only a file name, not
       a path. The path is automatically taken from the pool device **PooPath** property.
    
    3. The controller class name: This is the name of the class implementing
       the controller. This class has to be implemented within the controller
       shared library or Python module passed as previous argument
    
    4. The controller instance name: This parameter is optional. If you do
       not specify it, the command will return information concerning
       controller properties as defined at the class level. If you defined
       it, the command will return information concerning controller
       properties for this specific controller instance.
    
    
It returns to the caller all the informations related to controller
properties as defined in the controller code and/or in the Tango
database. The following format is used to return these informations: 

1. The string describing the controller (or an empty string if not
   defined)

2. Number of controller properties

3. For each property:

    1. The property name
    
    2. The property data type
    
    3. The property description
    
    4. The property default value (Empty string if not defined)
    
    
- **ReloadControllerCode** : The controller code is contains in a shared library dynamically
  loaded or in a Python module. The aim of this command is to unlink the
  pool to the shared library and to reload it (or Reload the Python
  module). The command argument is a string which is the controller file
  name as defined for the CreateController command. For motor
  controller, it is not possible to do this command if one of the motor
  attached to controller(s) using the code within the file is actually
  moving. All motor(s) attached to every controller(s) using this file
  is switched to FAULT state during this command execution. Once the
  code is reloaded, an "Init" command is sent to every controller
  devices.

- **SendToController** : Send data to a controller. The first element of the input argument
  array is the controller name. The second one is the string to be sent
  to the controller. This command returns the controller answer or an
  empty string is the controller does not have answer.

- **CreateMotor** : This command creates a new motor. It has three arguments which are:

    1. The motor name (a string). This is a Tango_ device alias. It is not
       allowed to have '/' character within this name. It is a case
       independent name.
    
    2. The motor controller name (a string)
    
    3. The axe number within the controller
    
    
The motor is created as a Tango_ device and automatically registered in
the database. At next startup time, all motors will be automatically
re-created. A Tango_ name is assigned to every motor. This name is a
Tango_ device name (3 fields) and follow the syntax:
    
    
    motor/controller_instance_name/axe_number
    
in lower case letters. 

- **DeleteMotor** : This command has only one argument which is the motor name as given
  in the first argument of the CreateMotor command. The device is
  automatically unregistered from the Tango_ database and is not
  accessible any more even for client already connected to it.

- **CreateMotorGroup** : This command creates a new motor group. It has N arguments which
  are:

    1. The motor group name (a string). This is a Tango_ device alias. It is
       not allowed to have '/' character within this name. It is a case
       independent name.
    
    2. The list of motor element of the group (motor name or another group
       name or pseudo-motor name)
    
    
The motor group is created as a Tango_ device and automatically
registered in the database. At next startup time, all motor groups
will be automatically re-created. A Tango_ name is assigned to every
motor group. This name is a Tango_ device name (3 fields) and follow
the syntax:

    mg/ds_instance_name/motor_group_name

in lower case letters. 

- **DeleteMotorGroup** : This command has only one argument which is the motor group name as
  given in the first argument of the CreateMotorGroup command. The
  device is automatically unregistered from the Tango_ database and is
  not accessible any more even for client already connected to it. This
  command is not allowed if another motor group is using the motor group
  to be deleted.

- **GetPseudoMotorInfo** : 
  XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \label{sub:GetPseudoMotorClassInfo}: 
  : This command has one input argument (a string):

    **<module_name>.<class_name>**
        
    
    The command returns a list of strings representing the pseudo motor
    system information with the following meaning: 
    
    pseudo_info[0] - textual description of the pseudo motor class. 
    
    pseudo_info[1] - (=M) the number of motors required by this pseudo
    motor class. 
    
    pseudo_info[2] - (=N) the number of pseudo motors that the pseudo
    motor system aggregates. 
    
    pseudo_info[3] - the number of parameters required by the pseudo motor
    system.

    M pseudo motors. 
    
    pseudo_info[N+M+6..N+M+P+6] - the textual description of the P
    parameters. 
    
    
**example** : 



::

    GetPseudoMotorInfo('PseudoLib.Slit') 

    could have as a return: 
    
    


::

    ["A Slit system for controlling gap and offset pseudo motors.",
    "2",
    "2",
    "0",
    "Motor on blade 1",
    "Motor on blade 2",
    "Gap",
    "Offset"]

- **CreatePseudoMotor** :This command has a variable number of input arguments (all strings):

    1. the python file which contains the pseudo motor python code.
    
    2. the class name representing the pseudo motor system.
    
    3. the N pseudo motor names. These will be the pseudo motor alias for the
       corresponding pseudo motor tango devices.
    
    4. the M motor names. These names are the existing tango motor alias.
    
    N and M must conform to the class name information. See 
    XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:GetPseudoMotorClassInfo}: 
    to find how to get class information. 
    
    For each given pseudo motor name a Tango_ pseudo motor device is
    created and automatically registered in the database. At next startup time, all pseudo motors will be automatically re-
    created. A Tango_ name is assigned to every pseudo motor. This name is
    a Tango_ device name (3 fields) and follow the syntax:
        
        pm/python_module_name.class_name/pseudo_motor_name
    
    For each Tango_ pseudo motor device the device pool will also create a
    corresponding alias named pseudo_motor_name. 
    
    If a motor group Tango_ device with the given motor names doesn't exist
    then the device pool will also create a motor group with the following
    name: 
    
    mg/tango_device_server_instance_name/_pm_<internal motor group number> 
    
    This motor group is built for internal Pool usage. It is not intended
    that the pseudo motor is accessed directly through this motor group.
    However, if needed elsewhere, it can be accessed as the usual motor
    group without any special restrictions. 
    
    
**example:** 

CreatePseudoMotor('PseudoLib.py','Slit','gap01','offset01','blade01','
blade02') 

- **DeletePseudoMotor** : This command has only one argument which is the pseudo motor
  identifier. The device is automatically unregistered from the Tango
  database and is not accessible any more even for client already
  connected to it. This command is not allowed if a motor group is using
  the pseudo motor to be deleted.

  module. The aim of this command is to reload the Python module. The
  command argument is a string which is the python module as defined for
  the CreatePseudoMotor and GetPseudoMotorInfo commands. It is not
  possible to do this command if one of the motor attached to pseudo
  motor system(s) using code within the file is actually moving. All
  pseudo motor(s) using this file are switched to FAULT state during
  this command execution.

- **CreateExpChannel** : This command creates a new experiment channel. It has three
  arguments which are:

    1. The experiment channel name (a string). This is a Tango_ device alias.

    2. The experiment channel controller name (a string)
    
    3. The index number within the controller
    
    
The experiment channel is created as a Tango_ device and automatically
registered in the database. At next startup time, all created
experiment channels will be automatically re-created. A Tango_ name is
assigned to every experiment channel. This name is a Tango_ device name
(3 fields) and follow the syntax:

    expchan/controller_instance_name/index_number

in lower case letters. The precise type of the experiment channel
(Counter/Timer, ZeroD, OneD...) is retrieved by the pool device from
the controller given as command second parameter. 

- **DeleteExpChannel** : This command has only one argument which is the experiment channel
  name as given in the first argument of the CreateExpChannel command.
  The device is automatically unregistered from the Tango_ database and
  is not accessible any more even for client already connected to it.

- **GetConstraintClassInfo** : This command has one input parameter (a string) which is the
  constraint class name. It returns to the caller all the information
  related to constraint dependencies and to constraint properties as
  defined in the constraint code. The following format is used to return

       independent name.
    
    2. The list of channel elements of the group (Counter/Timer, 0D, 1D or 2D
       experiment channel)
    
    
The measurement group is created as a Tango_ device and automatically
registered in the database. At next startup time, all measurement
groups will be automatically re-created. A Tango_ name is assigned to
every measurement group. This name is a Tango_ device name (3 fields)
and follow the syntax:

    mntgrp/ds_instance_name/measurement_group_name

in lower case letters.

- **DeleteMeasurementGroup** : This command has only one argument which is the measurement group
  name as given in the first argument of the CreateMeasurementGroup
  command. The device is automatically unregistered from the Tango
  database and is not accessible any more even for client already
  connected to it.

- **AddConstraint** : This command creates a user constraint object. It has several
  arguments (all strings) which are:

    1. Constraint code file name: The name of the constraint module. This
       parameter is only a file name, not a path. The path is automatically
       taken from the pool PooPath property.
    
    2. Constraint class name: This is the name of the class implementing the
       controller. This class has to be implemented within the controller
       shared library or Python module passed as previous argument

on the same object. They will be executed in the order of their
creation. Each created constraint has a associated name which is:
    
    <Constraint class name>/<Instance name>
    
- **DeleteConstraint** : This command has only one argument which is the constraint name as
  define previously.

- **EvaluateConstraint** : This command has only one argument which is the constraint name. It
  runs the "evaluate" method of the constraint and sends the return
  value to the caller

- **GetConstraint** : The input parameter of this command is the name of a Tango_ object.
  Actually, it has to be the name of one of the motor Position
  attribute. The command returns the list of Constraint ID attached to
  this object.

- **ReloadConstraintCode** : The constraint code is contains in a Python module. The aim of this
  command is to reload the Python module. The command argument is a
  string which is the constraint file name as defined for
  theAddConstraint command. All object(s) using this constraint are
  switched to FAULT state during this command execution.

- **LoadTangoClass** :

- **UnloadTangoClass** :

- **ReloadTangoClass** :

- **CreateXXX** :

- **DeleteXXX:**

- **ArchiveMotorPosition** : Send new motor(s) position to the database. This command will be
  polled with a default polling period of 10 seconds.

The classical Tango_ **Init** command destroys all constructed controller(s) and re-create them
reloading their code. Then, it sends an "Init" command to every
controlled objects (motor, pseudo-motor and motor group) belonging to
the pool device. Motor(s) are switched to FAULT state when controller
are destroyed. 

The pool device knows only two states which are ON and ALARM. The pool
device is in ALARM state if one of its controller failed during its
initialization phase. It is in ON state when all controllers are
correctly constructed. In case the pool device in in ALARM state, its
status indicates which controller is faulty. 


Device pool attributes

- **ControllerClassList** : This is a read only spectrum string attribute. Each spectrum element
  is the name of one of the available controller class that the user can
  create. To build this list, the pool device server is using a property
  called **PoolPath** which defines the path where all files containing controller code
  should be (Python and C++ controllers). The syntax used for this
  PoolPath property is similar to the syntax used for Unix PATH
  environment variable (list of absolute path separated by the ":"
  character). Each returned string has the following syntax:

      Type: <Ctrl dev type> - Class: <Ctrl class name> - File: <Abs ctrl
      file path>
      
- **MotorList** : This is a read only spectrum string attribute. Each spectrum element
  is the name of one motor known by this pool. The syntax is:

  path. See 
  XXX: Unknown inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:PoolPath}:

- **ConstraintClassList** : This is a read only spectrum string attribute. Each spectrum element
  is the name of one of the available constraint class that the user can
  create. To build this list, the pool device server is using a property
  called **PoolPath** which defines the path where all files containing constraint code
  should be. The syntax used for this property is similar to the syntax
  used for Unix PATH environment variable (list of absolute path
  separated by the ":" character). To find constraint classes, the pool
  will look into all Python files (those with a .py suffix) for classes
  definition which inherit from a base class called **PoolConstraint** .

- **ConstraintList** : This is a read only spectrum string attribute. each spectrum element
  is one of the constraint actually registered in the pool. The syntax
  of each string is:
  
      <Constraint class name/instance name> - <associated to> - <depending
      on attribute(s) - <depending on device(s)>
      
- **SimulationMode** : This is a read-write scalar boolean attribute. If set to true, all
  the pool device(s) are switched to Simulation mode. This means that

Some words on internal implementation
=====================================

This chapter gives some details on some part of the pool
implementation in order to clarify reader ideas 


Moving motor
------------

Moving a motor means writing its Position attribute. In Tango, it is
already splitted in two actions which are: 

1. Call a Motor class method called "is_allowed"

2. Call a Motor class method called "write_Position"

The second method will be executed only if the first one returns true.
The move order is sent to the motor (via the controller) in the code
of the second method. 


The is_allowed method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The code implemented in this method follow the algorithm: 



::

    - /IF/ There are any Pseudo Motor using the motor
       - /FOR/ All these Pseudo Motors
          - /IF/ They have some limits defined
             - Compute new Pseudo Motor position if motor moved to the desired value
             - /IF/ The computed value is outside the authorized window
                 - Return False
             - /ENDIF/
          - /ENDIF/
       - /ENDFOR/
    - /ENDIF/
     
    - /IF/ There are some user constraint attached to the motor
      - /FOR/ Each user constraint
          - /IF/ The constraint has some depending attribute(s)
             - Read these attributes
          - /ENDIF/
          - /IF/ If the execution of the contraint "Evaluate" method returns False
             - Return False
          - /ENDIF/
      - /ENDFOR/
    - /ENDIF/
     
    - Return True


The write_Position method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The code implemented in this method follows the algorithm: 



::

    - Compute the dial position from the user position
    - /IF/ A backlash is defined for this motor and the controller does not manage it
        - Update motor desired position according to motion direction and backlash value
    - /ENDIF/
    - Start a thread sending it which motor has to move to which position
    - Wait for thread acknowledge
    - Return to caller

The motion thread will execute the following algorithm: 



::

    - /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the motion
         - Lock the controller object
         - Call PreStartAll()
    - /ENDFOR/
     
    - /FOR/ Each motor(s) implied in the motion
         - ret = PreStartOne(motor to move, new position)
         - /IF/ ret is true
              - Call StartOne(motor to move, new position)
         - /ELSE/
              - Inform write_Position that an error occurs
              - Send acknowledge to write_Position method 
         - /ENDIF/
    - /ENDFOR/
     
    - /FOR/ Each motor(s) implied in the motion
         - Set motor state to MOVING and send a Tango_ event to the requesting client
    - /ENDFOR/
     
    - /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the motion
         - Call StartAll()
         - Unlock the controller object
    - /ENDFOR/
     
    - Send acknowledge to the write_Position method
     
    - /WHILE/ One of the motor state is MOVING (From controller)
         - Sleep for 10 mS
     
         - /IF/ One of the motor implied in the motion is not moving any more
            - /IF/ This motor has backlash and the motion is in the "wrong" direction
                - Ask for a backlash motion in the other direction
                  (Easy to write, not as easy to do...)
            - /ENDIF/
            - Send a Tango_ event on the state attribute to the requesting client
            - Leave the loop
         - /ENDIF/
     
         - /IF/ it is time to read the motor position
            - Read the motor position
            - Send a change event on the Position attribute to the requested client if
              the change event criterion is true
         - /ENDIF/
    - /ENDWHILE/
     
    - Sleep for the time defined by the motor (group) Sleep_bef_last_read property
    - Read the motor position
    - Send a forced change event on the Position attribute to the requesting client
      with the value set to the one just read
    


Data acquisition
----------------

Data aquisition is triggered by invoking a Start command on the
measurement group. The code implemented implements the following
algorithm. 



::

    /IF/ in timer mode
        - Write CumulationTime on all 0D channels with Integration_time value
    /ELIF/ in monitor mode
        - Write CumulationTime on all 0D channels with 0(zero) value
    /ENDIF/
    
    /FOR/ Each 0D channel implied in the data aquisition
        - Load configuration 
    /END FOR/
    
    - Start a CounterTimer thread with channels involved, master channel and the proper value to be set on it
    - Wait for CounterTimer thread acknowledge
    
    /FOR/ Each 0D channel implied in the data aquisition
        - Send Start command 
    /END FOR/
    
    - Return to caller

The Counter/Timer thread will execute the following algorithm: 



::

    - Calculate the list of controllers involved and determine which controller has the master channel
    /FOR/ Each channel(s) implied in the data aquisition
        - Lock the channel object
    /END FOR/
    
    /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the data acquisition
        - Lock the controller object
    /END FOR/
    
    /FOR/ Each channel(s) implied in the data acquisition
        - Load configuration 
    /END FOR/
    
    - Load the master channel - timer(monitor) - with the integration time(count)
    
    /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the data acquisition
        - Call PreStartAllCT()
    /END FOR/
    
    /FOR/ Each channel(s), except for the master channel, implied in the data acquisition, 
        - Call PreStartOneCT(channel)
        - Call StartOneCT(channel)
    /END FOR/
    
    /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the data aquisition
        - Call StartAllCT()
    /END FOR/
    
    - Call PreStartAllCT() on the controller which contains the master channel
    - Call PreStartOneCT(master channel)
    - Call StartOneCT(master channel)
    - Call StartAllCT() on the controller which contains the master channel
    
    /FOR/ Each controller(s) implied in the data aquisition
        - Unlock the controller object
    /END FOR/
    
    /FOR/ Each channel(s) implied in the data aquisition
        - Unlock the channel object
    /END FOR/
    
    - Send acknowledge to the Start method
    
    /WHILE/ master channel state is MOVING (From controller)
         - Sleep for 10 * sleepTime mS
     
         /IF/ If master channel is not moving any more
            - Stop all channels
            - Send a Tango event on the state attribute to the requesting client
            - Leave the loop
         /ENDIF/
     
         /IF/ it is time to read the channel values
            - Read the channel values
            - Send a change event on each value attribute to the requested client if
              the change event criterion is true
         /ENDIF/
    /ENDWHILE/
    
    - Read the channel values
    - Send a forced change event on each value attribute to the requesting client
      with the value set to the one just read

Writing recorders
=================

Overview
---------

Sardana macros may produce data and users are usually interested in storing
or visualizing it. Sardana delegates this work to the recorders.
A good example of the recorder usage are the scan macros developed with the
:ref:`sardana-macros-scanframework`. Recorders are in charge of writing data to
its destinations, for example a file, the Spock output or to plot it on a graph.

What is a recorder?
-------------------

Recorder class is a Sardana element managed by the MacroServer. It is
identified by its name, and is located in a recorder library - another Sardana
element which is also identified by its name. Recorders are developed as
Python classes, and recorder libraries are just Python modules aggregating these
classes.


Writing a custom recorder
-------------------------

.. todo:: finish chapter based on user's input

This chapter provides the necessary information to write recorders in Sardana.

Before writing a new recorder you should check the `Sardana plugins
catalogue <https://github.com/sardana-org/sardana-plugins>`_.
There's a chance that somebody already wrote one that fits your needs.

If finally you decide to write a new one, below you can find some useful
information:

* Your recorder class would need to inherit from ``DataRecorder``
  (or ``BaseFileRecorder`` if you write data to a file) and
  implement minimum the following methods:

  * ``_startRecordList``
  * ``_writeRecord``
  * ``_endRecordList``

  You can find some examples in ``sardana.macroserver.recorders`` module.
* Recorder classes are used to instantiate recorder objects in a scan.
  Every time a scan starts, in its preparation phase, a new recorder object
  gets created. Reversely, at the end of the scan the recorder object gets
  destroyed. If you need to keep a long lived objects in your recorder
  you may consider using the :term:`singleton pattern`

Configuration
-------------

Custom recorders may be added to the Sardana system by placing the recorder
library module in a directory which is specified by the MacroServer
:ref:`RecorderPath <sardana-configuration-macroserver>` property.

In case of overriding recorders by name or by file extension (in case of the
file recorders), recorders located in the first paths are of higher priority
than the ones from the last paths.

Three types of overriding may occur:

**By recorder library name**
   If Python modules with the same name are located in different directories, 
   the library located in the the higher priority directory will be loaded.

**By recorder name**
   If two recorder classes with the same name appear in two different modules,
   only the recorder from the library located in the higher
   priority module will be loaded. If both modules are located in the same
   directory, the behavior is undetermined.

**By file extension**
   If two different recorders supporting the same file extension appear in two 
   different modules, the one from the higher priority path will be used
   when selection is based on the extension (but both will be available for the
   selection by name). If both of these recorders' modules are located in the
   same directory, the system will assign a list of recorders to a given
   extension. Then the application is in charge of deciding which one to use.

As previously mentioned recorders are selectable by either the extension
(using the :ref:`ScanFile <scanfile>` environment variable) or the recorder name
(using the :ref:`ScanRecorder <scanrecorder>` environment variable).

During the MacroServer startup the extension to recorder map is
generated while loading the recorder libraries. This dynamically created map
may be overridden by editing the :data:`~sardana.sardanacustomsettings.SCAN_RECORDER_MAP`.

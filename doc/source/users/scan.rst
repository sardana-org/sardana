Scans
=====

Perhaps the most used type of macro is the scan macros. In general terms, we
call *scan* to a macro that moves one or more :ref:`motors <sardana-motor-api>`
and acquires data along the path of the motor(s).

.. note:: Sardana provides a :ref:`Scan Framework <sardana-macros-scanframework>`
   for developing scan macros so that the scan macros behave in a consistent way.
   Unless otherwise specified, the following discussion applies to scan macros
   based on such framework.

The various scan macros mostly differ in how many motors are moved and the
definition of their paths.

Typically, the selection of which data is going to be acquired depends on the
active *measurement group* and is *not* fixed by the macro itself (although
there is no limitation in this sense).

Depending on whether the motors are stopped before acquiring the data or not, we
can classify the scan macros in *step* scans or *continuous* scans,
respectively.

Step scans
----------

In a step scan, the motors are moved to given points, and once they reach each
point they stop. Then, one or more channels are acquired for a certain amount
of time, and only when the data acquisition is finished, the motors proceed to
the next point.

In this way, the position associated to a data readout is well known and does
not change during the acquisition time.

Some examples of step scan macros are:
:class:`ascan`,
:class:`a2scan`, ...
:class:`dscan`,
:class:`d2scan`, ...
:class:`mesh`.

Continuous scans
----------------

In a continuous scan, the motors are not stopped for acquisition, which
therefore takes place while the motors are moving. The most common reason for
using this type of scan is optimizing the acquisition time by not having to
wait for motors to accelerate and decelerate between acquisitions.

The continuous scans introduce some constraints and issues that should be
considered.

#. If a continuous scan involves moving more than one motor simultaneously
   (as it is done, e.g. in :class:`~sardana.macroserver.macros.scan.a2scan`),
   then the movements of the motors should be synchronized so that they all
   start their path at the same time and finish it at the same time. 
#. If motors do not maintain a constant velocity along the path of their
   movement, the trajectories followed when using more than one motor may not
   be linear.
#. While in step scans it is possible to scan two pseudo-motors that access
   the same physical motors (e.g. the *gap* and *offset* of a slit, being both
   pseudo-motors accessing the same physical motors attached to each blade of
   the slit), in a continuous scan the motions cannot be decoupled in a
   synchronized way.
#. Backslash correction is incompatible with continuous scans, so you should
   keep in mind that continuous scans should only be done in the backslash-free
   direction of the motor (typically, by convention the positive one for a
   physical motor).


In order to address the first two issues, the
:ref:`scan framework <sardana-macros-scanframework>` attempts the following:

* If the motors support changing their velocity, Sardana will adjust the
  velocities of the motors so that they all start and finish the required path
  simultaneously. For motors that specify a range of allowed velocities, this
  range will be used (for motors that do not specify a maximum allowed
  velocity, the current "top velocity" will be assumed to be the maximum)
* For motors that can maintain a constant velocity after an acceleration phase
  (this is the case for most physical motors), Sardana will transparently
  extend the user-given path both at the beginning and the end in order to
  allow for the motors to move at constant velocity along all the user defined
  path (i.e., the motors are allowed time and room to accelerate before
  reaching the start of the path and to decelerate after the end of the nominal
  path selected by the user)
   
These two actions can be seen in the following plot of the positions of the two
motors involved in a :class:`~sardana.macroserver.macros.scan.a2scanc`.

.. figure:: /_static/trend_a2scanc.png 
   :width: 100%
   :figwidth: 80%
   :align: center

   Trend plot showing a two-motor continuous scan 
   (:class:`a2scanc` *m_cp1_1 100 200  m_cp1_2 0 500 .1*).
   The lines correspond to the motor positions and the blue shaded areas correspond to the intervals in 
   which the data acquisition took place.  
 
Both motors are capable of same velocity and acceleration, but since the
required scan path for m_cp1_1 is shorter than that for m_cp1_2, its top
velocity has been adjusted (gentler slope for m_cp1_1) so that both motors go
through the user-requested start and stop positions simultaneously.

The same figure also shows how the paths for both motors have been automatically
(and transparently, for the user) extended to guarantee that the user defined
path is followed at constant velocity and that the data acquisition takes place
also while the motors are running at constant velocity.

The synchronization of movement and acquisition can be done via hardware or
via software. Currently Sardana provides two different interfaces for
continuous scans. They can be easily differentiated by the scan name suffix:

* *c* - allows only software synchronization
* *ct* - allows both software and hardware synchronization (introduced with
  SEP6_)

In the *c* type of scans, in order to optimize the acquisition time, Sardana
attempts to perform as many acquisitions as allowed during the scan time. Due
to the uncertainty in the delay times involved, it is not possible to know
beforehand how many acquisitions will be completed. In other words, the number
of acquired points along a continuous scan is not fixed (but it is guaranteed
to be as large as possible). Some examples of continuous scan macros are:
:class:`ascanc`,
:class:`a2scanc`, ...
:class:`dscanc`,
:class:`d2scanc`, ...
:class:`meshc`. 


In the *ct* type of scans, Sardana perform the exact number of acquisitions
selected by the user by the means of hardware or software synchronization
configurable on the
:ref:`measurement group <sardana-measurementgroup-overview>` level.
The software synchronized channels may not follow the synchronization pace and
some acquisitions may need to be skipped. In order to mitigate this risk an
extra latency time can be spend in between the scan points. Another possibility
is to enable data interpolation in order to fill the gaps in the scan records.
Some examples of continuous scan macros are:
:class:`ascanct`,
:class:`a2scanct`, ...
:class:`dscanct`,
:class:`d2scanct`, ...
At the time of writing the *ct* types of continuous scans
still do not support acquiring neither of: :ref:`1D <sardana-1d-overview>`,
:ref:`2D <sardana-2d-overview>`, :ref:`Pseudo Counter <sardana-pseudocounter-overview>`
nor external attributes e.g. Tango_ however their support is planned in the
near future.

.. note::
    The creation of two different types of continuous scans is just the result
    of the iterative development of the :ref:`Scan Framework <sardana-macros-scanframework>`.
    Ideally they will merge into one based on the *ct* approach. This process
    may require backwards incompatible changes (up to and including removal of
    the affected scan macros) if deemed necessary by the core developers.


Configuration
-------------

Scans are highly configurable using the environment variables
(on how to use environment variables see environment related macros in
:ref:`sardana-standard-macro-catalog`).

Following variables are supported:

**ApplyInterpolation**
    Enable/disable the `zero order hold`_ a.k.a. "constant interpolation"
    method to fill the missing parts of the scan records in case the software
    synchronized acquisition could not follow the pace. Can be used only
    with the *ct* type of continuous scans. Its value is of boolean type.
    
    .. note::
        The ApplyInterpolation environment variable has been included in
        Sardana on a provisional basis with SEP6_. Backwards incompatible
        changes (up to and including removal of this variable) may occur if
        deemed necessary by the core developers.

**DirectoryMap**
    In case that the server and the client do not run on the same host, the scan
    data may be easily shared between them using the NFS. Since some of the
    tools e.g. showscan rely on the scan data file the DirectoryMap may help in
    overcoming the shared directory naming issues between the hosts.

    Its value is a dictionary with keys pointing to the server side directory
    and values to the client side directory/ies (string or list of strings).

**ScanDir**
    Its value is of string type and indicates an absolute path to the directory
    where scan data will be stored.

**ScanFile**
    Its value may be either of type string or of list of strings. In the second
    case data will be duplicated in multiple files (different file formats may
    be used). Recorder class is implicitly selected based on the file extension.
    For example "myexperiment.spec" will by default store data in SPEC
    compatible format (see more about the extension to recorder map in
    :ref:`sardana-writing-recorders`).

**ScanRecorder**
    Its value may be either of type string or of list of strings. If
    ScanRecorder variable is defined, it explicitly indicates which recorder
    class should be used and for which file defined by ScanFile (based on the 
    order).

    Example 1:
	
	::

		ScanFile = myexperiment.spec
		ScanRecorder = FIO_FileRecorder

        FIO_FileRecorder will write myexperiment.spec file.

    Example 2:

	::
	
		ScanFile = myexperiment.spec, myexperiment.h5
		ScanRecorder = FIO_FileRecorder

        FIO_FileRecorder will write myexperiment.spec file and
        NXscan_FileRecorder will write the myexpriment.h5. The selection of the
        second recorder is based on the extension.

**SharedMemory**
    Its value is of string type and it indicates which shared memory recorder should
    be used during the scan e.g. "sps" will use SPSRecorder (sps Python module
    must be installed on the PC where the MacroServer runs).

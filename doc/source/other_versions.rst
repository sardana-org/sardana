Docs for other Sardana versions
===============================

The `main Sardana docs <http://sardana-controls.org>`_ are generated for the
most recent development version.

You can still generate the docs for other versions of Sardana. In order to do that
you first need to clone the `Sardana repository <https://github.com/sardana-org/sardana>`_,
checkout the necessary version and build the docs (this may require you to install 
some dependencies apart from the sardana ones, such as sphinx).

In continuation you can find an example of how to do it for version ``2.8.3``:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone -b 2.8.3 https://github.com/sardana-org/sardana
    cd sardana
    python setup.py build_sphinx
    firefox build/sphinx/html/index.html

.. note::
   Sardana versions >= 3 work only with Python 3. Then you will need to build
   the documentation with ``python3`` instead of ``python``.
